## ► Introduction

* Check the [FAQ page](https://old.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq#wiki_.25BA_games) for some frequently-asked game-related questions

* **EMPRESS** releases to 1337x

* The sites described below as having **Scene releases** will contain releases from the Scene groups **CODEX, CPY, SKIDROW, HOODLUM, RELOADED, SiMPLEX, DARKSiDERS, PLAZA**, etc. [What is "The Scene"?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/32isgo/noobpirate_what_is_a_scene_cracktorrent/)

* The sites labeled **REPACKS** are for releases that have been repacked from the original (pirated) release (whether it is a Scene, P2P, or GOG release). The intent of a repack is to provide one-click, pre-cracked installations as well as smaller filesizes, and in many cases, also provide DLCs included in the installation as an All-In-One package. Not to be confused with [The Scene's definition of REPACK](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/9r54lr/what_does_proper_and_repack_mean/)

* To check if a game has been cracked by the Scene, jump to the [Scene Tracer section on the Megathread's Tools page](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/tools#wiki_.25BA_scene_.2F_p2p_tracer_websites). For a general overview of Scene game releases: https://predb.ovh/?q=%40cat%20games

* Cracked game downloads will always have a readme `*.txt` or `*.nfo` file containing instructions. If you need further assistance, visit /r/CrackSupport 

* For more news of game releases (Scene as well as P2P), visit /r/CrackWatch. For more subreddits, such as Console hacking, ROM piracy, etc, visit the [Related Subreddits page](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/related_subreddits)

## ► Relevant Software/Tools

**Download Managers**

> These are useful for DDL sites. Download managers such as these are meant to help to speed up downloads, typically by increasing the number of connections to the server or attempting to split the download into chunks. They are also especially handy when grabbing multiple links at once, which is typical with DDL sites, where they'll split up large downloads into multiple small `.rar` parts, as well as bypassing captchas and eliminating the risks of clicking on the wrong download button on various file hosts. They also help with resuming paused or timed out downloads which your browser may not be able to do in some cases.

* [JDownloader2](http://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2) - Download manager that supports downloading from a variety of file-hosts. Supports downloading video from many websites.
* [Internet Download Manager \(IDM\)](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/download.html) - Paid download manager that supports downloading from a variety of file-hosts.

The Information Revolution is leading us to the age of the Internet where optical communication networks a key role in delivering massive amounts of data. Information can no longer be stopped. 


You have the ability to discern for your self. My goal is to connect and strengthen your connection with your intuition so you can find your own truths. 

This course is organized in the best way possible to independently stimulate your mind, body, and soul. I will try to expand the optimism that is already there, as well as teach you how to tap into the many abilities that you have. 

This is my first time making a course, so over the next year you may see things added and edited. You will always have access to this course and any new information. I do wanna apologize if a lot of my information seems all over the place. I wanted to make this course as precise as possible.

Fiction is fabricated and based on the author's imagination. You are the author to your own story so create any reality that you want.

You almost have to be insane to have such blind faith in something you can't see. This course will change that.

Im not here to force a new belief system onto you, more so for you to experience this spiritual essence that is all around us. 

As you get to the end of the course you will have all the information you would need to do so. Your beliefs will be tested as well as expanded with what you'll experience through breath and meditation. 

My goal is to teach you how to take control of your mind and teach you some meditations that allow you to tap in beyond this veil and what is meant for you will come to you if you'll allow it.

The law of awareness explains that no action will come from a non belief. 

This system hijacks your beliefs so it can manipulate and control your actions. As your awareness grows your consciousness expands. You are here because you have unbecome what society has done to you or you're just starting your journey, either way I'm sure you have questions. 

This course is my personal interpretation of what is beyond the veil. I have many truths that I will share in this course. I do not expect you to believe all of them and I encourage you to challenge them and question them. 

Before you get started, if you are going to base your expectations only on what you see then you'll blind yourself to the possibilities of a new reality. Lose expectation and discover your truths. 



Please be prepared to look at things from 9 sides of the spectrum.

Also forgive me on any grammar errors, I didn't have anything professionally edited.



There is a war going on, the battlefield is in the mind. The prize is the soul.

Indoctrination:

The process of teaching a person or group to accept a set of beliefs uncritically.

In today’s society when people have a masters degree understand the psychology behind having a masters degree. That means you have been successfully indoctrinated into a specific way of thinking that is why psychology is a prerequisite in most curriculums. They need to make sure that if you want access to certain parts of the matrix you need to have your mind removed and the indoctrinated mind inserted so now you can’t think for yourself. 

To get a masters degree you have to go through that so you can get that stamp of approval to show that you are a worker and not a thinker.

- John D Rockefeller

John Davidson Rockefeller born July 8, 1839 is regarded as the wealthiest person of all time. 

Prior to the late 1800s education was a private practice that took place in private institutions or through homeschooling that all changed in 1902 when John D. Rockefeller created the General Education Board in conjunction with Frederick T. Gates. Rockefeller poured a significant amount of investments into the education system he created the general education board at the ultimate cost of $129 million and provided major funding for schools across the nation and was very influential in shaping the school system. 

Rockefeller said, "I don’t want a nation of thinkers I want a nation of workers." even more compelling are the words of Frederick T. Gates business advisor to Rockefeller, "we shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning or of science." 

This is the Origin of modern day slavery. 

We are literally sending our children to school to get programmed to work for him while our parents are already working for him.

In the school system they don’t want us to learn about money because they just want to pump out good employees that take orders. 

For the most part school teaches you the opposite of what it takes to be successful in real life. 

Don’t make mistakes.

Do what you are told.

Take tests by yourself.

There’s only one right answer but the truth is there’s many answers for one problem. 

You come out of school scared to death to make a mistake. There’s no synergy, people come out of school paralyzed. 

The school system is criminal and it kills a Childs spirit for learning. 

School gets us all excited ready to learn, it’s gonna be great and then you get to school and the teacher tells you to sit down and shut up, do what you’re told, you don’t get to learn what you wanna learn just what they force you to learn. 

People look at wealth and their fancy cars and associate it majority of the time with everything else other than going to a University. 



This debt based system is criminal.



We are all playing this game. understanding the system will help you navigate it without letting it corrupt you negatively.


When you think about the 3 great religions Judaism, Christianity and Islam all have one thing in common, a separation from God. They believe that God is up in the Heavens and we are down here waiting for him to come. 

The eastern religions had a much different philosophy and it also lines up with the Jesus philosophy which is you and God are one, that’s what Jesus said.

I am not this body I am an extension I am an expression of my soul just as I am an extension of YH WH source God. It’s not that I am God I am an extension of God and Gods expression

Jesus Christ said that the father and he dwell in you inside of you so if you were looking for God you must look inside yourself that’s why God calls himself "I am

It’s not that you are God, you are God if you allow him to be. The apostle Paul said it is no longer I who lives in here but the Christ within me because when you get into meditation you lift yourself over the thoughts of the carnal mind you raise yourself into that blissful nothingness of Nirvana and there you become one with God 

When there are no thoughts in your mind you are God.

They’ve main streamed this action of looking up for God but we see empty space with infinite possibilities. It is the ultimate deception. We have all of these people in power that just phrase all this deception in so many ways that’ll blow your mind. 

There’s more galaxies in the universe then grains of sand on all the beaches in the world, so you’re thinking that a galaxy is full of solar systems, full of planets so now your mind goes infinite. Anything you can imagine is there but it’s also completely void of everything. It’s brilliant and evil and we see complete emptiness like we’re a speck, we are nothing, we are a ball spinning at Mach 38 with no direction in a sea of emptiness that we can’t possibly comprehend.

Nothing is there but simultaneously anything you can possibly imagine is up there. They merge science-fiction and reality, infinite emptiness, infinite possibilities, you put it in the same place people used to look for God, now God is hidden. 

They go to the moon but suddenly now in today’s age with our current technology we no longer can go to the moon. They tell us they erased all the tapes and no other countries went to the moon so we can't. How can we believe that, how can you live in a world where you’re not skeptical enough. 

It’s like we just are all trying to fit in. Realizing the lies is so freeing, makes you realize that cognitive dissonance that people feel all the time, they can’t put their finger on it and they just get angry at so many things, just let it go.

Cognitive Dissonance:

the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes, especially as relating to behavioral decisions and attitude change.

The early Christians Essenes Knew that the scriptures whether written in ancient Hebrew or Greek were allegories, parables or fables based on the human body fearfully and wonderfully made. 

-Dr. George Carey

The fall of the Christos oil from the cerebrum to the sacrum. The 33 vertebrae, your spine. Jacobs ladder, 33 degrees. This is why you hear in free masonry the highest level you can achieve is 33.



Jacob dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the Lord stood above it. - Genesis 28:12



Christos Oil:

The Greek word Christos translates the Hebrew word Moshiach or Messiah. All those words mean “the Anointed One.” When we call upon Jesus Christ, we invoke the fact that Our Lord is anointed. Throughout the Bible, anointing means the application of oil to someone's body usually in the middle of the forehead.



Around the same time John D Rockefeller seized US media he also hijacked US medicine.

When it was discovered that drugs could be produced from petroleum the most powerful people in the oil business had an army of propagandists to invert reality, to work against medicines that were used for thousands of years. 

These medicines were suddenly classified as alternatives while the new petroleum based highly addictive and patentable drugs were declared the gold standard. 

After buying the German pharmaceutical company that manufactured chemicals of war for Adolf Hitler, Rockefeller leveraged his political influence by pressing Congress to declare natural healing remedies unscientific crockery. 

Rockefeller then took control of the American Medical Association and began offering massive grants to top schools under the mandate that they only teach his approved curriculum. Any information of the healing Powers of herbs, plants and diets were erased from most medical textbooks. 

Doctors and professors who objected to Rockefeller‘s plans were crucified by the media, removed from the American Medical Association and were stripped of their license to teach and practice medicine.

Those who dared to speak out  were arrested and jailed. When evidence began to emerge that petroleum based medicines were causing cancer, 

Rockefeller founded the American Cancer Society. 

This is where he suppressed all information. John D. Rockefeller is credited as the founder of the pharmaceutical industry and the main reason why medical error is currently the third leading cause of death in America.  

This is not an indictment against doctors, they are just under the stranglehold of the single largest lobby in power in Washington. 

Every year the pharmaceutical industries spends nearly twice the amount as big oil to influence laws policies and public perception thanks to Mr. Rockefeller the architect of American monopoly no industry has more power over our lives then big Pharma.

I just want you to understand where the term Pharmacy came from.

The very first translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek later became the accepted text of the old testament in the Christian church and the basis of its canon 

Pharmakeia In Greek translation means magic, sorcery, witchcraft, enchantment, drugs or medicine

Into todays language we have pharmacy and pharmacist


Revelation 18:23

And the light of a candle shell shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee; for the merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy Pharmakeia We’re all nations deceived.

New testament says; "for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived"

Sorceries - Pharmakeia

In America were taught that deities such as Zeus, Poseidon, Athena, Ares, Artemis, Hermes, Hephaestus, and other Greek gods are just myths and fiction but in other countries they actually believe them to be true and people still worship them till this day.

If you look to the Holy Bible and Greek mythology you can easily find correlation between the two. Greek mythology may just be the story of the fallen angels. 

The underlying truth is that multiple religions speak about multiple gods. In todays society you can easily find a lot of Greek mythology symbols because the powers at hand worship these gods still to this day which come from Hebrew texts.

The pharmacy symbol people believe is the kundalini rising up the spine to the third eye chakra opening up the minds eye.

Its the staff of Caduceus which belonged to Hermes messenger of gods with the ability to convey messages between the divine realms of the underworld and the world of the mortals, so you can see the correlation.

Regardless what the concrete truth is, there is massive amounts of deception and hidden messages in many religions.



Solomon's temple - the soul of man’s temple - the brain. In the middle of the temple was the holy trinity, your pineal gland.

DIVINITY IS INSIDE YOU. IF YOU WANT TO SEEK GOD, TURN INWARD AND MEDITATE.



Most law abiding men inside the matrix, the future life that is laid out for you is usually nothing but depressing. You’re gonna go to school, 

get in debt, 

get a job, 

get a wife, 

potentially get divorced, 

potentially lose the house, 

potentially your job, 

Inflation is always creeping, now you’re old and your life is over and that is the matrix. You’re gonna work, work, work, that is a matrix for 99% of men.



You can no longer sit there and just follow the rules and if you’re a man it’s your job to find a way to not be sticking to those rules enough so you can break out of the matrix and become free. I am praying that this course can help bridge and fortify your attempt.



No society wants you to become wise, it’s against the investment of all societies. If people are wise they cannot be exploited. 

If they are intelligent, 

they cannot be subjugated, 

they cannot be forced into the mechanical life, to live like robots,

they will assert their individuality, 

they will have the fragrance of rebellion around them,

they would like to live with freedom,

freedom comes with wisdom and no society wants people to be free, 

the communist society, 

the fascist society, 

the capitalist society, 

the Hindu, 

the Mohammedan, 

the Christian, 

no society would like people to use their own intelligence because the moment they start using their own intelligence they become dangerous,

dangerous to the establishment, 

dangerous to the people who are empower, 

dangerous to the herds,

dangerous to all kinds of oppression,

exploitation, 

suppression,

dangerous to the churches, 

dangerous to the state, 

in fact a wise man is a fire, a living flame. He would rather die than to be enslaved.

Think about it if there’s a health food section in the grocery store what does that make the rest of the food sold there



Honestly this segment is just a bunch of random information so brace yourself.



Mainstream media is finally admitting what conspiracy theorist  have been saying all along there are thousands of toxins chemicals that are being added to our food and water supply.

Things such as plastic wrap on microwavable foods is poison and microwaving it is even more poisonous. Nail polish being toxic, the chemicals are absorbed through your nails and then deposit into your organs causing birth defects, hormone disruption, disruption of melatonin which will give you sleeping disorders. As well as canned food being heavily poisonous. 

A woman's period isn't suppose to hurt or last longer than 3 days.

The FDA never considers the overall effect of these 10,000 chemicals on peoples health. The sad part is that's the FDA’s job that they haven’t been doing for decades. 

It’s proven now that the additive effect of low levels of different chemical exposures can impact a baby‘s IQ and therefore his or her ability to excel in school and contribute to society at large. 



No disease including cancer can exist in an alkaline environment Nobel prize winner for cancer discovery 

Dr. Otto Warburg in 1931 said this.

Metabolic Dysfunction:

A metabolic disorder occurs when abnormal chemical reactions disrupt the body's metabolism. This could affect how well the body can break down large molecules for energy, how efficiently cells can produce energy or cause problems with energy regulation.

There’s a new study that sugar doesn’t cause diabetes and obesity at all. If you want obesity and diabetes you have to actually break cellular function in someway so you need to cause metabolic dysfunction before you can have these really serious chronic conditions.

Sugar actually doesn’t do that by itself. The new study is showing that seed oils like hydrogenated vegetable, oil sunflower oil, canola oil, cause obesity and diabetes on their own.

They took a bunch of rodents in studies and fed them zero sugar and pumped them full of canola oil and that give them insulin resistance and diabetes in the absence of sugar. 

The western society growth of chronic disease and obesity epidemic clearly speaks that there's literally no difference between food and poison.

Western Society B12:

Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is naturally found in animal foods. It can also be added to foods or supplements. Vitamin B12 is needed to form red blood cells and DNA. It is also a key player in the function and development of brain and nerve cells. Vitamin B12 binds to the protein in the foods we eat.

One of the reasons sea moss has been touted as a superfood recently is that it's a vegan, gluten-free source of many nutrients. Some of the nutrients contained in sea moss include: Vitamin B2. Vitamin B12

The most common form of B12 in the world is entirely synthetic. They make it from hydrogen cyanide, it’s called cyanocobalamin. It’s a cyanide base B12 vitamin, they are literally making vitamins out of hydrogen cyanide. Vitamins are synthetically made,

flintstone vitamins, 

airborne, 

celsius energy drinks, 

emergency - c,

and many other products that list B12 as an ingredient.

When you put this form of B12 into the body it drops off the cobalamin, a light metal into the cell and then you’re left with a floating cyanide molecule. 

The body doesn’t recognize it. In order for cyanide to leave the system it binds to oxygen and other light metals in the body and takes them out of the system with it.

Its literally robbing you of your health.



Cyanide:

Cyanide is a rapidly acting, potentially deadly chemical that can exist in various forms. Cyanide can be a colorless gas, such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or cyanogen chloride (CNCl), or a crystal form such as sodium cyanide (NaCN) or potassium cyanide (KCN).



Cyanocobalamin:

a vitamin found in foods of animal origin such as liver, fish, and eggs, a deficiency of which can cause pernicious anemia. It contains a cyanide group bonded to the central cobalt atom of a cobalamin molecule.



Hydrogen cyanide:

Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a colorless or pale-blue liquid or gas with a bitter, almond-like odor. Hydrogen cyanide interferes with the body's use of oxygen and may cause harm to the brain, heart, blood vessels, and lungs. Exposure can be fatal.

Respiratory effects: respiratory tract irritation, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath (dyspnea), and transient increase in the rate and depth of breathing (hyperpnea). GI effects: nausea and vomiting (emesis). Severe: CNS effects: coma, seizures, and dilated pupils (mydriasis).



A study in 2012 more than 99% of breast cancer samples analyzed contained parabens a common carcinogenic ingredient found in deodorants such as suave, old spice and degree as well as many more. 

The amount of sugar consumption in food destroys our magnesium levels. Refined sugar has been weaponized against us and our children. One molecule of sugar you consume it takes 54 molecules of magnesium for your body to process it. 

The worst thing going to restaurants and indulging in the table salt not knowing that high sodium levels will wreak havoc on the skin, consuming too much table salt will cause premature wrinkles as a result of dehydration. That’s why it’s important to use natural sea salt because it contains 84 of the 102 minerals your body needs and it’s completely natural. 

We've been practicing medicine for over 200 years 

but yet there’s no cure for a common cold, 

no cure for diabetes, 

no cure for cancer, 

leukemia, 

sickle cell anemia, 

AIDS, 

blindness, 

and no other diseases. 

If any of these doctors actually studied herbs they could cure every disease known to man but yet 2,000 years later we aren’t doing so and it’s because the healer has been educated and the substance he uses is artificial and he is totally unaware of that. 

People don’t go into a field of research they go into a field of being told what to do and that is the brainwashing mentality that colleges that are created by the pharmaceutical companies are creating and are maintaining because your Health is a multi trillion dollar business.

Disease can only exist in an environment that is acidic. It is inconsistent to utilize inorganic substances when treating disease because they are of an acidic base. Only consistent use of natural botanical remedies will effectively cleanse and detoxify a diseased body reversing it to its intended alkaline state. The war methodology aids sickle cell anemia, lupus, diabetes, arthritis, cancer, leukemia, herpes, epilepsy, fibroid, tumors, and a host of other diseases which have been successfully reversed in an alkaline body. In all honesty your best chance of living to a really old age is to avoid doctors and hospitals, learn herbal medicine and other forms of natural medicine unless you are fortunate enough to have a Naturopathic physician available. Almost all drugs are toxic and are designed only to treat symptoms and not cure anyone.

- Dr. Sebi

Why you should stay away from meat?

If meat is boiled long enough we receive a jelly like slime, mucus or paste this mucus substance soon becomes sour ferment and forms a bed for fungi, moulds and bacilli. 

Is mould a fungi?

Molds include all species of microscopic fungi that grow in the form of multicellular filaments, called hyphae. Molds can thrive on any organic matter, including clothing, leather, paper, and the ceilings, walls and floors of homes with moisture management problems even in the body.

In the digestion, this slime or paste is being secreted in the same manner. In the course of life, the intestines and the stomach are gradually being pasted and slimed up to such an extent that this paste of floral and this slime of faunal origin turn into fermentation, clog up the blood vessels and finally decompose the stagnating blood. 

This happens in your stomach whenever you consume meat which causes inflammation and your body starts to over produce acid which explains why people get acid reflex after eating meat. Inflames the mucus membrane, pumping excessive amounts of mucus in the body resulting in pathogens to thrive, eventually making them infectious, you sick and contagious. 

Do you know what happens when you cook carbohydrates?  

It forms a carcinogen called acrylamide, known toxin, known cancer-causing, but potato chips are still legal. 

All cooked carbohydrates form the carcinogen acrylamide. 

One molecule of sugar takes forty-four molecules of magnesium for your body to process it.

Things like table salt go through a process that strips the minerals out of it. Table salt makes you age faster. High sodium levels will wreak havoc on the skin. Consuming to much table salt will cause premature wrinkles as a result of dehydration. 



Foods to stay away from: 

Canned fruit and vegetables 

Seedless fruit 

Eggs 

Dairy 

Fish 

All Meats 

Poultry 

Soy Products 

Processed food

Wheat 

Sugar (besides date sugar and agave syrup) 

Alcohol 

All yeast or foods risen with yeast 

Foods made with baking powder 

Table salt (besides natural sea salt)

So just don't eat anything, ever. starve. just kidding if this is your first thought its okay. I understand that your not use to looking for alternatives but when you start to consistently it gets much easier.

Im sure there are clean restaurants that you can find good clean food from. Always choose quality over fast food. Whether its baby steps or your diving head first into this lifestyle just constantly move in a better direction.  

Fortified foods:

‌Fortified foods have added vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients.

‌Food makers add micronutrients to their products during production. They create chemicals that have vitamins and minerals. These chemicals don’t have noticeable tastes, textures, or smells when added to food.

‌Some foods naturally have certain micronutrients but lose them through cooking or storage. Food enrichment is when food producers add those nutrients back in. Unlike enriched foods, fortified foods don’t naturally include those nutrients. Stay away from these at all costs!

Things like apple cider vinegar are being used in main stream to give people the illusion as if it’s going to help them but it actually dehydrates tissue, organs and muscles, has an average pH level of 3.0 promotes acidosis in the body.

Acidosis is a condition in which there is too much acid in the body fluids. It is the opposite of alkalosis (a condition in which there is too much base in the body fluids) 

Damages the thyroid removing fluid and minerals from prostate and uterus.

contains 5 to 6% acetic acidic which strains kidneys, liver and bones.

Acetic acid is also known as ethanoic acid, ethylic acid, vinegar acid, and methane carboxylic acid; it has the chemical formula of CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a byproduct of fermentation, and gives vinegar its characteristic odor. Vinegar is about 4-6% acetic acid in water.

That fermentation helps bacteria thrive in the body.

Never touch purified or distilled water all that is boiled up tap water. 

Water needs minerals calcium magnesium potassium silica all the amazing minerals that your body actually needs 

When you drink pure water, water will look for minerals and will find those minerals in your body so that means it will pull it out of your body and you’re actually losing minerals by drinking that water. 

This is why I stack minerals in everything I do. Minerals is the key not the amount of protein, not the amount of vitamins, it’s all in the minerals. 

Japanese surgeon Hiromi Shinya was one of the pioneers for colonoscopy.

Colonoscopy is a procedure a doctor uses to look at the inside of the colon and rectum with a colonoscope, which is a long, flexible tube about the width of a finger with a light and small video camera on the end. It's put in through the anus and into the rectum and colon.

He did over 300,000 procedures to check your intestines and how diet affects it. He saw the correlation between a western diet that was filled with flour, meat, starch, toxins, processed foods and sugars.

He would just put his patients on a regimen of eating alkalizing fruits and vegetables and also drink from a surgical grade water ionizing device such as like a Kangen water machine and the results were so amazing that he started telling his patients he would not see them unless they drink this water for three months first.

These machines change the pH of water by running it across metal plates in a process called 'electrolysis. ' Making the water 'ionized' and 'alkaline.

These machines can cost around $5,000. However you are able to put a down payment and do monthly installments. I got my machine from a local vender from my home town, her name is Angela. You can contact her on Instagram for more information.

 https://instagram.com/alohahealingwater?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y= 

If you are unable to purchase a Kangen machine it is important know what water to look for when shopping. 



ONLY PURCHASE WATER THAT LISTS THE MINERALS AND THE MINERAL COUNT SPECIFICALLY.

Example: 

Bicarbonate Alkalinity 44 mg/L 

Silica 35 mg/L

Sodium 6.8 mg/L

Calcium 6.6 mg/L

Magnesium 3.5 mg/L

Potassium 1.9 mg/L



These numbers don't need to be exact, Most water is fortified and doesn't help the body at all. So when looking for water always read the bottle.

 
Fasting Explained

10 DISCUSSIONS
10DISCUSSIONSEnable fullscreen
Getting into fasting may be difficult for some because it involves a lot of self control but also detoxifying the body from many unnatural substances such as refined sugar and refined carbs. 

Most people have a sodium addiction and some of these cravings stacked with the programming on television and social media can have a heavy influence on your minds eye. This is why images can be used against you to attract things you do not need in your life. Like I've said if you cant control your urges you wont have control over your life. You can just hop right into fasting but if you feel you may struggle I suggest you start simply by cleaning your way of eating up first for a few days to make this process easier. Drinking alkaline water is allowed at all times as well as drinking tea as long as it is unsweetened. 

Understanding your body and the feeling of adjusting to a different lifestyle. Going through the motions will be tough at first. you may experience withdrawals from sugar meat dairy gluten and other foods. these withdrawals will get easier to deal with as you stick to your movement into an alkaline way of eating. Weight will fluctuate, water retention and inflammation are the first to go. 

Food is the most abused anxiety drug, fasting is the most forgotten cure, exercise is the most under used anti-depressant.

Western medicine has brainwashed us to treat our symptoms causing our bodies to only mask the problems we have and by the time we get to a certain age its to late. It all comes down to the food we are consuming. No chronic illness should exist. Western way of eating has us thinking we need to eat 3 meals a day, the reality is we should not be eating everyday at all. After 24 hours of not eating the body goes into ketosis. 

What is Ketosis?

Ketosis is a process that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates to burn for energy. Instead, it burns fat and makes things called ketones, which it can use for fuel. The truth is burning fat as fuel is way cleaner for the body and brain. refined carbs as a fuel source is devastating to the body. Consistently fasting will help you get into ketosis more often. after 48 of not eating your body goes into homeostasis. 

What is homeostasis?

Homeostasis has become the central unifying concept of physiology and is defined as a self-regulating process by which an organism can maintain internal stability while adjusting to changing external conditions. After 48-72 hours the body will activate its growth hormone and produce new stem cells. 

What is the growth hormone? 

Growth hormone (GH) or somatotropin, also known as human growth hormone (hGH or HGH) in its human form, is a peptide hormone that stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and cell regeneration in humans and other animals. It is thus important in human development.

Myth: 

Your body doesn't eat its muscles when you fast. Glycogen levels drop at first so you will feel fatigued. After you adjust, levels balance. Take creatine to help if your lifting weights actively, stay away from monohydrate creatine. Only take creatine HCL (NON BLOATING) Male or Female alike. Understand even if your body was at 7% body fat it is equivalent to over 30,000 stored calories and can sustain you for over a month.      

How long it takes your body to remove certain foods.

Gluten - 3 to 4 months

Sugar - 2 weeks, 

Meat - 2 to 3 months

Dairy - 3 weeks

Coffee - 3 weeks

Alcohol - 8 days

Window Fasting:

This method of fasting is for beginners, Depending on your schedule consistently give yourself a window of 3-4 hours for eating. 

Example:

Monday Though Sunday -  1 pm - 5 pm

As you adjust to this way of eating make your window smaller and smaller until you get use to eating in a window of only 1 hour per day getting you close enough to a 24 hour fast.



Alternate Fasting:

Intermediate, Incorporate window fasting every other day, and only eat on those days that you have an available window,

Example:

Monday - No Food

Tuesday - Window Fast

Wednesday - No Food 

Thursday - Window Fast

Friday - No Food

Saturday - Window Fast

Sunday - Window Fast or No Food



Celestial Fasting:

I recommend this method of fasting at least once a week. Getting a 3 day straight fast will help achieve ketosis, homeostasis, and your growth hormone. You will produce new stem cells to repair and replaced damage cells. Cure any ailment with this fasting method as long as you stay within the alkaline way of eating your body will start to heal overtime. My own personal experience doing this for 3 months straight changed my life. 

Example:

Monday - Window Fast

Tuesday - No Food

Wednesday - No Food

Thursday - Window Fast 

Friday - No Food

Saturday - Window Fast

Sunday - No Food

We currently see animals living longer than us. The average lifespan of a whale is 200 years versus a human is only 72 years and declining. 

Why is that?

It’s because animals or most animals are adapted to their natural habitat, we are not. We have been put in an artificial environment and given concepts of cooking, concepts of what true food is. 

Everything starts from that primitive gut tube.



The Primitive gut tube develops during week 3-4 by incorporating the yolk sac during craniocaudal and lateral folding of the embryo. The tube is divided into 3 distinct sections; foregut, midgut and hindgut. Foregut gives rise to the esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, pancreas and proximal duodenum.



When you are born there are three things that are created simultaneously at the same time, that’s 

the nervous system, 

primitive gut tube, 

and the lipid sac.



The lipid Sac is the lymphatic system for it can clean up all the byproducts that the baby is getting from eating all the food that the mother eats. Then you also have the blood and lymph which is called the inter-station fluid of the body and this is all the same chemical composition 

Chemical composition refers to the arrangement, type, and ratio of atoms in molecules of chemical substances. Chemical composition varies when chemicals are added or subtracted from a substance, when the ratio of substances changes, or when other chemical changes occur in chemicals.



From there you get the primitive gut tube where everything grows from,

they call it the ectoderm, mesoderm and the endoderm. 

The ectoderm gives rise to the skin and the nervous system. The mesoderm specifies the development of several cell types such as bone, muscle, and connective tissue. Cells in the endoderm layer become the linings of the digestive and respiratory system, and form organs such as the liver and pancreas.

This is how holistic health is:

Your skin is made from the same cells as your brain, so if you have a skin problem something wrong with your brain. If you start looking at your internal organs they’re made from the same things as your eyes. 

We all really need to be re-educated on what real love is. Real self-love because if we had that it would make us do the right research but again we’re letting people create our environment and put us in these circumstances, the ground is malnutrition they’ve completely messed up the soil, the fruits that we are eating now are lacking a lot of vital nutrients and nutrition. 



Things we had 100 years ago have changed dramatically because of what they’re doing to the earth. If you look at it from a physical standpoint, just physiology from our small intestinal track even when you get into the pH balance called trypsin and amylase and the way our mouth and our salivary glands produce these alkalizing breaking down agents we are FRUGIVORES just people don’t believe you can break down the sugar is in fruit because they think of it the same way as white sugar but you can actually eat fruit without worrying about the sugar aspect.



There’s three main bases of sugar, galactose, fructose which is naturally occurring in your fruits and you have glucose which is naturally occurring in your vegetables.

Your fructose yields 12,000 Angstroms of energy your glucose or your vegetables only yield 9000 Angstroms of energy. 

The only way you can heal diabetes type 1 or type 2 is through fructose. 

When you get somebody with diabetes and their insulin dependent, you have some thing called the Islets of Langerhans.



The islets of Langerhans are a cluster of cells within the pancreas that are responsible for the production and release of hormones that regulate glucose levels.



Western nutrition will say that sugar raises the glucose, your glucose is low on fruits. 

which is a total lie!



Every person from the holistic way of living that has been cured of diabetes type one and type two, hyperglycemia or had diabetes mellitus we’re healed on an all fruit diet with minimal herbs.

The Reason why:

when you eat fructose, fructose bypasses the pancreas. The pancreas has something called the Islets of Langerhans. 

You have the Alpha cells which produce glycogen, 

you have the beta cells that produce insulin, 

then you have the delta cells that produce somatostatin:



Somatostatin is a hormone that regulates a variety of bodily functions by hindering the release of other hormones, the activity of your gastrointestinal tract and the rapid reproduction of cells.

Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by the Islets of Langerhans, which regulates the amount of glucose in the blood. The lack of insulin causes a form of diabetes. An animal-derived or synthetic form of insulin used to treat diabetes.



Which is a mixture of growth pituitary hormone, it’s mixed with glycogen to break down glucose and put glucose in the blood to penetrate a cell. That’s what insulin does.



Growth pituitary hormone:

Growth hormone is produced by our brain's pituitary gland and governs our height, bone length and muscle growth. Some people abuse synthetic growth hormone in the mistaken belief it will help them increase muscle size and strength.



Insulin is used as a key, 

Insulin is the key that takes glucose and unlocks the cellular membrane. Then the cell swallows the glucose, eats it, it gets broken down and metabolized by something called the mitochondria, then you yield something called ATP AMP and ADP.

adenosine triphosphate is a compound consisting of an adenosine molecule bonded to three phosphate groups, present in all living tissue. The breakage of one phosphate linkage (to form adenosine diphosphate, ADP ) provides energy for physiological processes such as muscular contraction.

Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is one of the components of RNA and also the organic component of the energy-carrying molecule ATP. In certain vital metabolic processes, AMP combines with inorganic phosphate to form ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and then ATP.

Adenosine diphosphate (ADP), also known as adenosine pyrophosphate (APP), is an important organic compound in metabolism and is essential to the flow of energy in living cells.

this is the energy.

So we are talking about carbon. Carbon is on your periodic table, carbon is sugar.



Mitochondria:

An organelle found in large numbers in most cells, in which the biochemical processes of respiration and energy production occur. It has a double membrane, the inner layer being folded inward to form layers (cristae).



Sugar breaks down into carbon. You eat sugar, once the sugar gets converted in the body it is CHO.

CHO is carbohydrates.

The conversion is taken out of that hydrogen because hydrogen is acidic so once you take the hydrogen out of the CHO it’s just carbon and oxygen, this is alkaline. 

So sugar is alkaline. 

What’s not alkaline is when they take the sugar out of some thing like corn because corn has natural fructose, then they burn it and change the chemical composition. They put fire to it and the moment you put fire to it, it changes the chemical composition. now they’re heightening it so they call this high fructose corn syrup. 

It’s no longer a fructose it becomes a dextrose or it becomes a pentose which is a five sugar phosphate or they call it sucrose these things are called polysaccharides, we’re not talking about monosaccharides. 

Monosaccharides is what’s in your fruits what’s in your vegetables polysaccharides is what they’re creating in these man made laboratories and that is what is bad for us. 



Dextrose is the name of a simple sugar made from corn or wheat that’s chemically identical to glucose or blood sugar. Dextrose is often used in baking products as a sweetener, and is commonly found in items such as processed foods and corn syrup.

Pentose is any of the class of simple sugars whose molecules contain five carbon atoms, such as ribose and xylose. They generally have the chemical formula C5H10O5.

Sucrose is a disaccharide, is a sugar composed of glucose and fructose subunits. It is produced naturally in plants and is the main constituent of white sugar. It has the molecular formula C. 12H. 22O.

Polysaccharides a carbohydrate (e.g. starch, cellulose, or glycogen) whose molecules consist of a number of sugar molecules bonded together.

Monosaccharides is any of the class of sugars (e.g., glucose) that cannot be hydrolyzed to give a simpler sugar.

How amazing fruits are.

If you are diabetic your pancreas usually has fluke worm, fascioliasis worm, buski worm, hook worm, threadworm. Usually you find parasites inside of the pancreas when somebody is suffering from diabetes. 

Usually you find out mucus is down or the adrenals are down because the adrenals are in control of something called the autonomic nervous system the prefix to autonomic is auto. These are the things that run on auto pilot, 

digestion, 

flickering of your eyes, 

breathing, 

lung capacity, 

heartbeat.

All of these are controlled by the parasympathetic sympathetic autonomic nervous system. 

Your pancreas yielding insulin is a nervous system issue because the adrenals are down. The reason why they’re down is because your eating the wrong foods and these foods are creating toxins and byproducts that you’re not getting out of your body because you haven't opened up the lymphatic system and the kidneys to filtrate all of the toxemia out so.

Toxemia is blood poisoning by toxins from a local bacterial infection. 



That’s the pancreas being down! 



So what food can I eat that doesn't break down the glucose?

The only other food is fructose. 

Yes your glucose will be low for a couple of days. 

You may experience, 

sweating, 

paleness, 

hunger, 

fatigue, 

irritability, 

anxiety, 

rapid heart rate, 

lack of concentration. 

This is because you’re introducing your body to a new sugar but it’s a natural occurring sugar. 

You have two types of digestion, you have the pancreas digested enzymes that break down the actual glucose. 

Process: The pancreas yield's the Islets of Langerhans and yield‘s insulin to turn that key to bring glucose to the cell so you can have energy. 

Fructose completely bypass the pancreas, it goes a lipid route. This lipid route is through the liver and its called cellular infusion where the sugar will infuse its self in the cell and doesn't even use the pancreas.

Yield is to produce or provide (a natural, agricultural, or industrial product).



There’s plenty government articles written up on this. Just research association of plasma bio makers of fruit and vegetable intake with incident type two diabetes epic interact case cohort study in eight European countries. 

https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/305629

On the holistic side they have clinical trials with at least 100 diabetics type 1 & 2 that prove that they healed them on an all fruit diet with minimum herbs.



Which fruits have the greatest production for ATP? 

Fruits that grow highest to the sky. 

Carbohydrates  

Carbon hydrogen and oxygen mixed together. Once the oxygen gets out these are called high-yielding carbon constituent chains. 

Mangoes

Coconuts 

Cucumbers 

These are very electrical foods and now we’re getting into something called H302

H3O2 is a form of extremely pure water that's found in fruits and vegetables and is healthier than regular H2O

H2O which is normal water that we see on the shelves mostly actually just dehydrates you. The most beautiful thing about fruits is not only can you eat the fruit to get the macro substance, you also get the micro substance which is the structured jelly water called H302 in it. So you’re supposed to eat your fruits for your water and your macro constituent and we’re talking about the actual mycelium network. Now we are talking about mushrooms.



Mycelium is a network of fungal threads or hyphae. Mycelia often grow underground but can also thrive in other places such as rotting tree trunks. A single spore can develop into a mycelium. The fruiting bodies of fungi, such as mushrooms, can sprout from a mycelium.



This is an invisible network that everything is, without mushrooms we wouldn’t even be here. Everything exists off  of this mycelium network 



In other words, the DNA in fungi more closely resembles the DNA of the inhabitants of the animal kingdom. We are nearly 100% alike as humans and equally closely related to mushrooms. Only a few tiny changes in our DNA structure set us apart, giving us our variations in eye, skin, and hair



The main Chemical constituents of mushrooms is carbon.

Carbon is sugar, glucose, galactose and fructose even when you get into the mushroom kingdom you’re still talking about a high sugar diet.



Life itself is pro life. 

Side note:

Luciferianism is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to Lucifer, the name of various mythological and religious figures associated with the planet Venus. The tradition usually reveres Lucifer not as the devil, but as a destroyer, a guardian, liberator, light bringer or guiding spirit to darkness, or even the true god as opposed to Jehovah. 

The highest form of worship in Luciferianism is an inversion of Gods will.

Taking life instead of giving life. You cannot kill out of love amongst many other things. Many of our concepts today line up with this inversion more than we know.




The Cure

There was 3 networking groups that were filming a documentary where they took several individuals to an island to do a 40 day spring water fast. 

The individuals all had ailments that were said to be not curable by doctors. 

AIDs, 

herpes,

diabetes type 1 and 2,

and others.

By day 18 the most amazing thing happened, every person was testing negative for whatever ailment they had. 

Not sure how this happened but all 3 networking groups got cancelled and they were no longer permitted to film. 

Fortunately people that participated are now speaking up about the experience. 

Since then I have been helping people walk away from their chronic illnesses by fasting and optimizing their organs with minerals combining everything I've learned from many holistic doctors.

Previous lessons explained why minerals are important. The current concepts of nutrition in this artificial system are not meant for us but more importantly these synthetics are robbing our bodies of minerals. 

All chronic illnesses come from mineral deficiencies 


So if we’re looking to accurately cure every ailment, the first thing we need to understand is where it stems from. 

That is 100% environment of the acidic body.  

So how do we overcome this?

The body‘s natural basic function is an alkaline state and these acidic GMO synthetic foods are coming from the current concepts of Western nutrition so they can prescribe you Western medicine. 

Changing the bodies pH level can cause death or harm is what many Doctors say in todays society.  

The truth is your bodies basic function is an alkaline state and you can’t eat things that are natural and have it mess up your pH level and it cause you harm let alone death. 

So any ailment that you may be experiencing the fastest way to cure that is fasting with minerals and eating raw fruits and vegetables.



My best source of minerals and sea moss are found in my link tree at the end of the course. 





Why does urine upcycling seems to kill the bacteria and viruses that your body doesn’t want and nourish the microbial and the good bacteria in your body?

That’s a really fascinating question because modern medicine can’t even do that and anyone who has had chemotherapy will tell you it kills everything, the good stuff and the bad stuff.

That’s why your hair falls out,

the nails turn nasty, 

digestion falls apart, 

the skin turns ashen, 

because it’s destroying the good microbiome along with the bad microbiome. 

Why does urine do the self selecting process?

Now that has everything to do with what’s in it.



Composition of Human Urine

19.51% Cholesterol 

0.13% Serotonin 

13.35% Triglycerides 

10.27% Hydroxyindoleacetic acid

5.85% Vanillylmandelic acid

0.05% Peptides 

1.54% Lysozyme

0.39% Amylase 

20.54% Albumin

0.12% Catecholamines



Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in your blood. Your body needs cholesterol to build healthy cells, but high levels of cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease. With high cholesterol, you can develop fatty deposits in your blood vessels.

Serotonin is a chemical that carries messages between nerve cells in the brain and throughout your body. Serotonin plays a key role in such body functions as mood, sleep, digestion, nausea, wound healing, bone health, blood clotting and sexual desire

Triglycerides are a type of fat (lipid) found in your blood. When you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn't need to use right away into triglycerides. The triglycerides are stored in your fat cells. Later, hormones release triglycerides for energy between meals.

5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) is the major metabolite of serotonin and is excreted in the urine. Intestinal carcinoid tumors, along with neuroendocrine tumors, can produce excess amounts of 5-HIAA and serotonin, especially in individuals with carcinoid syndrome.

Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) is a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of artificial vanilla flavorings and is an end-stage metabolite of the catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine). It is produced via intermediary metabolites.

Homovanillic acid (HVA) is a major catecholamine metabolite that is produced by a consecutive action of monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase on dopamine. Homovanillic acid is used as a reagent to detect oxidative enzymes, and is associated with dopamine levels in the brain.

Metanephrine are made when your body breaks down hormones called catecholamines. These hormones are made by the adrenal glands. Catecholamines help your body respond to stress. They are sometimes called "fight or flight" hormones. They also include epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

Normetanephrine is a metabolite of norepinephrine created by action of catechol-O-methyl transferase on norepinephrine. It is excreted in the urine and found in certain tissues. It is a marker for catecholamine-secreting tumors such as pheochromocytoma.

Immunoglobulins is any of a class of proteins present in the serum and cells of the immune system, which function as antibodies.

Peptides is a short chain of amino acids (typically 2 to 50) linked by chemical bonds (called peptide bonds). A longer chain of linked amino acids (51 or more) is a polypeptide. The proteins manufactured inside cells are made from one or more polypeptides.

Lysozyme is a naturally occurring enzyme found in bodily secretions such as tears, saliva, and milk. It functions as an antimicrobial agent by cleaving the peptidoglycan component of bacterial cell walls, which leads to cell death.

Amylase is an enzyme, a type of protein that helps your body break down carbohydrates. The pancreas and salivary glands in your mouth make amylase. There's normally a small amount of amylase in your blood and urine. But levels that are too high can indicate a health problem

Albumin is a protein in your blood plasma. Your liver makes albumin. Albumin keeps fluid from leaking out of your bloodstream. It also helps vitamins, enzymes, hormones and other substances circulate throughout your body

Catecholamines are hormones made by your adrenal glands, two small glands located above your kidneys. These hormones are released into the body in response to physical or emotional stress. The main types of catecholamines are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Epinephrine is also known as adrenaline.

When you start to do this urine therapy your ability to create clean valuable water from your urine is compromised because your body isn’t used to doing something like this but the more you do urine therapy the taste of it changes.

Many people that have been actively doing urine therapy say that their urine starts to taste more like an electrolyte drink, taste like the most hydrating electrolyte drink they've ever had.

That can potentially make you a little curious or you can just give it resistance. 

Got me thinking like damn I have my own electrolyte drink, it’s made from my body, I don’t need to buy sports drinks, it’s always with me, I can’t really get dehydrated.



Google will tell you that in 1918 Poon Lim initially kept himself alive by drinking the water and eating the food on the raft, but later resorted to fishing and catching rainwater in a canvas and using his life jacket covering. This man was out at sea for 4 months.  

He was in the Navy and his ship was torpedoed, according to a government debriefing he ran out of food and he upcycled his pee. They found him 4 months later expecting him to be in bad condition if not dead, he wasn’t at all. Reports had said he responded saying I’m feeling all right and I feel pretty strong.

The reason why is because his body was upcycling his own protein feeding his tissue, he wasn’t emaciated.

We literally have a self contained system but they don’t want you knowing these things. The concepts of what we are taught make us think we could never fathom drinking our own urine. 

The truth is the more urine up cycling you do the more self-contained you get, the more inter-dependent you get with nourishment because then you’re up cycling nourishment so you start to pay much more attention to what you’re up cycling, foods your putting in your body. Your up cycling probiotics, antibodies, and enzymes.



Probiotics, denoting a substance which stimulates the growth of microorganisms, especially those with beneficial properties

antibodies, a blood protein produced in response to and counteracting a specific antigen. Antibodies combine chemically with substances which the body recognizes as alien, such as bacteria, viruses, and foreign substances in the blood.

Enzymes, are proteins that help speed up metabolism, or the chemical reactions in our bodies. They build some substances and break others down. All living things have enzymes. Our bodies naturally produce enzymes

Allow me to get to the best part!

A doctor in the 1930s fresh out of school from the Rockefeller foundation wrote a book on urine therapy. He talks about how urine can change in the body based upon emotions.

When you’re angry your urine comes out alkaline but when you’re happy and blissful your urine will come out acidic. So when you’re happy and you’re in a good state of mind your urine becomes really acidic because it’s detoxing and killing all the bacteria in the body and it’s able to eliminate it. Clean your eating enough and the body will fully detox its self. 

This also taps into your state of mind and how you can make yourself sick. Negative emotions make it difficult for the body to detoxify itself so its not that crazy that we can manifest sickness. 

There are many things that our bodies are capable of but these concepts are not being taught because your health is a business.

Highly Structured Water

Water is underappreciated! Your muscle consists of over 99 percent water molecules, but the water in your cells is not regular water, but highly structured water with special properties. It is also known as exclusion zone water or ez water defined by Dr Gerald Pollack.

H3O2 Living Water 
This highly structured water is referred to as fourth phase of water, not H2O but H3O2, and can be called living water. It’s more viscous, dense, and alkaline than regular water; has a negative charge, and can hold energy, much like a battery, and deliver energy too.

Structured water & far infrared energy (FIR water energy)
The key ingredient to create this highly structured water is light, i.e. electromagnetic energy, whether in the form of visible light, or infrared wavelengths, which we’re surrounded by all the time.

One reason why infrared saunas make you feel so good is because your body’s cells are deeply penetrated by infrared energy, which builds and stores structured water. The same goes for light therapy, spending time in the sun, and laser therapy.

Your cells are negatively charged
Your cells are negatively charged and some believe that the water inside your cells is negatively charged giving your cells this negative charge. 

Besides optimizing your drinking water by vortexing (also achieved with magnetic energy), you can help support your body’s negative charge by connecting to the earth, which also has a negative charge. This is the basis of the earthing (waking bare foot) or grounding technique.

Rapid Release of Toxins
Numerous toxins are absorbed and stored in our bodies every day. Substances like lead, mercury and chlorine, and carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide gases are encapsulated by large water molecules. When toxins are present in the body, blood circulation is blocked and cellular energy is impaired. Further, the body’s immune system is inhibited, which makes it difficult for the body to fight disease. FAR infrared heat expands the capillaries and skin pores and breaks down the ion bond to expel toxins from the body safely and naturally.

Maintaining a State of Alkalinity & negative charge in your cells
Maintaining a state of alkalinity and negative charge in your cells and body appears to be important for optimal health. Drinking water can be optimized in a variety of different ways, by injecting light energy or physical energy into the water by vortexing, for example. This is fairly easy using magnets. Viktor Schauberger did much of the pioneering work on vortexing about 100 years ago.




Circadian Clock

Following a sleeping schedule aligned with the sun and moon will help your body achieve higher states of consciousness.  

You wake up between 6 AM to 8 AM. Break your fast around 1 PM and then you go to sleep around10 PM-ish.

Around 12 AM that is when you hit the deepest states of sleep, that is when DMT is released. About 12 AM all the way to 4 AM, this is called REM sleep. 

REM Sleep:

a kind of sleep that occurs at intervals during the night and is characterized by rapid eye movements, more dreaming and bodily movement, and faster pulse and breathing.

Why is it important to be asleep during these times? 

You usually hear that between 3 AM and 4 AM is the witches hour.

Witches hour is the hour after midnight, when witches and other supernatural beings were thought to be active, and to which bad luck was ascribed. The hour between 3:00 a.m. and 3:59 a.m., associated with demons.

According to zodiac it’s ruled by Saturn, also known as Satan, also known as the RAM. That’s why they call it REM Sleep and if you take care of your circadian clock rhythm, you’re getting up at 6 AM and you’re going to sleep around 10 PM so you can release DMT.

People also can experience sleep paralysis at this time as well from 12 AM to 4 AM. That is when the sun is opposite of you, it is the farthest away from you. 



So your pineal gland will produce melatonin and DMT, 

your pituitary gland will produce serotonin,

and your thalamus will produce dopamine. 



Pineal gland:

The pineal gland is a small, pea-shaped gland in the brain. Its function isn't fully understood. Researchers do know that it produces and regulates some hormones, including melatonin. Melatonin is best known for the role it plays in regulating sleep patterns. Sleep patterns are also called circadian rhythms.

Pituitary gland:

The major endocrine gland. A pea-sized body attached to the base of the brain, the pituitary is important in controlling growth and development and the functioning of the other endocrine glands.

Thalamus:

Your thalamus is your body's information relay station. All information from your body's senses (except smell) must be processed through your thalamus before being sent to your brain's cerebral cortex for interpretation. Your thalamus also plays a role in sleep, wakefulness, consciousness, learning and memory.



In biblical references on how I speak about the Bible, correlating parables and fables of the human body, the significance to this is the three Wiseman that bring gifts to you. That bring gifts to Christ. 

It is also called the golden oil and in Greek it is Christos oil which I’ve mentioned before. Your circadian clock regulates your hormones.

Your hormones are Horus - moon. The moon and sun and sun and moon. This is your spirituality connection because you are influenced by the sun and the moon during the day and now at night time it’s the opposite.

So all of that energy is inverted which explains why you’re powerful during the day in your outer body and powerful in your inner body during the night. That's why, you dream, astral travel, remote view, and have premonitions. 





The Minds Eye

The Third Eye - Thalamus - Eye of Horus also known as the pineal gland.

The pineal gland has Piezoelectric Crystals inside of it. 

Piezoelectric means there is an alternating current inside your brain running otherwise known as a receiver of electricity. Understand the entire body is electrical.

When people talk about spiritual downloads this is what its from. Your third eye literally has photo receptors, rods and cones like your normal eyes. 

The Pineal Gland is part of the endocrine system that plays an important role in regulating almost every function in the body. This includes blood pressure, body temperature , sleep, mood, appetite, immune function and much more. 

On the spiritual side not only is it responsible for mental functions it’s also responsible for thought, perception, intuition, morality and clairvoyance. 

Many cultures also believe that the pineal gland is a portal to other dimensions which is why you experience dreams, visions and experiences beyond the veil. 

Many people in this system experience a calcified pineal gland. (Bryan) The pineal gland has one of the richest supplies of blood in the whole body which is why it’s not protected very well from toxins that build up in your body overtime.

Your pineal gland can become clogged like a pore. When your pineal gland calcifies you are potentially at risk for a host of health concerns including neurological diseases such as autism, depression, dementia, anxiety disorder and Parkinson’s disease. 

Fluorinated water is one of the main causes of the pineal gland calcification. All of these diseases are associated with abnormal sleep patterns which are directly linked to pineal gland dysfunction. So without the proper food intake, this may explain why manifesting may be extremely difficult. The worse the calcification the more things you may experience like constant headaches, anxiety, depression, osteoporosis, seasonal depression and when in those states there is no ability to create because the input is dialed too high so you’re forced to just react because the body is in survival mode. 

Horus is the name of a sky god in ancient Egyptian mythology.

The name Horus is the Latin version of the Egyptian Hor which means "the Distant One”. the sun.

Hour, Hours, Horus

Hours: A period of time equal to a twenty-fourth part of a day and night and divided into 60 minutes.

When you look at the sun it will tell you what time of the day it is what hour of the day it is Hence you get the word Ho•ri•zon - the Horus - ZONE. The line at which the earths surface and the sky appear to meet.

“The sun rose above the horizon” 

The sun rises above the equator - our creator. 

Horoscope astrology:

"A forecast of a persons future typically including a delineation of character and circumstances based on the relative positions of the stars and planets at the time of that persons birth."

You are in Horus's Scope - Horus's Eye. That’s why you get Horoscopes depending where the Horus eye is at what hour in the horizon - Eye of Horus the all seeing EYE, the sun.

Eye of Horus 

The eye of Horus in ancient Egyptian religion that represents well-being healing and protection.

The definition of Horus: 

The falcon headed Egyptian God of Light and the son of Osiris and Isis in the sun. 

You have the God of Light - Your third eye. Your defense mechanism which is being crucified. The system calcifies your light, the calcification of your pineal pine-eal, pinecone. Many things that we consume today affect our Minds Eye and it becomes calcified - calcification - crucifixion.

Look at your hand right now, right or the left. If you are right handed its better to try to look at your opposite hand. Your body‘s natural ability to sense energy with one hand is usually more dominant than the other and in your mind as you’re looking at your less dominant hand imagine a layer of energy that is flowing all around it.

That subtle awareness that you give thought to, you should feel a weird sensation around your hand.

If you don’t it’s okay because through the different forms of meditations that I will teach you I promise you will experience it.

Try to press your hands together, apply pressure, take multiple deep breath's and slowly bring your hands apart as well as slowly bringing them together without letting your hands touch. 

Now as you repeat this process with your breath, slowly moving your hands back-and-forth you should start to feel a form of magnetism or some form of force stopping your hands from touching.

It may be subtle, that is the energy that is all around you and through different forms of concentration and meditation you can amplify the energy around your hands. 

There are many things you can do with this energy but the only way you'll figure those abilities out is if you practice.

There are videos of people starting fires with their energy as well as massage therapists that can conduct electric shock therapy by creating a current in the body to produce a shock through their hands.

They can scientifically prove that serotonin isn’t just a signal of being happy, it’s a feedback loop to being happy. So constantly being in a state of happiness thoughtfully will feedback Loop happiness. 

A feedback loop is the part of a system in which some portion (or all) of the system's output is used as input for future operations. During the first stage, input is created. During the second stage, input is captured and stored.

Watch your mind all day long, it’s hard to just start off by controlling your thoughts. It takes a certain willpower and if you’re not there yet watch what it does, don’t judge it, you can meditate 24/7. 

Meditation is not always a sit down close your eyes activity. Meditation is basically just watching your own thoughts in your mind. 

You have your beliefs and convictions, then you have a lens to perceive personal reality, then you have an awareness to intercept and adjust your own perspective.

Just watch your thoughts and in certain circumstances just think to yourself, why am I having that thought, does that thought serve me anymore, is that conditioning from the system or from my upbringing. I look at life as a single player game, whatever you think, believe, will very much shape your reality both from what risks you take and what actions you perform. 

The further away you are from judgment, yourself as well as others, the closer you can find yourself.

On the contrary fall into too much judgment. You will separate from yourself and you will only feel good for an instant. 

Judging someone to make yourself feel good for an instant will only lead you to feel lonely. There’s a cause-and-effect to the feedback loops of our thoughts and falling into these tendencies, you'll only see negativity everywhere and you will be in a spiraling loop of your own creation.

The world literally just reflects your own feelings back at you, 

reality is neutral,

reality has no judgments,  

to a tree there is no concept of right and wrong good or bad. 

From the moment you’re born you start to have a whole century of experiences, stimulations of lights and colors and sounds and then you die.

How you choose to interpret that is up to you.

What makes up your experience is your choices between your actions, you have that choice. 



If you struggle with controlling your thoughts, a simple exercise you can do is choose a random song in your mind and play it, as that song is playing imagine picking up a remote control and just simply pressing the pause button.

After you do that  you should experience a brief moment of stillness where there’s nothing happening in your mind and now whenever another thought starts filtering in just hit the pause button again. Now if you’ve seen in my videos how I can control my Delta waves this is the technique that I use to do so. 

I press the pause button and I work on holding it for long periods of time which results my Delta waves to drop significantly but also naturally bringing my alpha waves dominant.

You can use devices such as the Muse 2, in my opinion its the best choice due to its low EMF output. iOS app I use with it is called Mind Monitor

EMF:

An area of electric and magnetic forces caused by electromagnetic radiation. Researchers are studying whether the EMFs from power lines, electrical appliances, and wireless and cellular telephones can cause cancer or other harmful health effects. Also called electromagnetic field.

You don't need this device though it helps when you see the graph change and you are able resonate with the feeling you are creating in your mind which makes it that much easier to recreate the feeling as well as amplify it.

Before you get into manifesting you need to understand that you have to be in alignment with what you want to attract.

As an example let’s say you’re lonely and you want to attract a relationship the frequency of love vibrates at 500 and if you’re lonely you’re vibrating between fear, grief and apathy which according to the Hawkins scale is way less than 500 so before you can receive love you have to be vibrating at level 500 instead of level 100.

How would you go about raising your vibration? 

Meditation and being mindful of your thoughts and paying attention to how you feel. example

Example:

You can’t experience peace if you’re experiencing fear when you’re feeling broke you cannot attract abundance and when you’re feeling sad you cannot attract happiness so the goal is to get to a higher state of feeling and the higher you move up the scale the more things you can attract.

The Hawkins Scale of Consciousness:

Enlightenment 700+ 

Peace 600 

Joy 540

Love 500 

Reason 400 

Acceptance 350 

Willingness 310 

Neutrality 250

Breath Work

It has been proven that the way you breathe will determine how long you live and the quality of your life, this is why some animals like tortoises can live over 200 years.

The word spirit literally means breath.

Gods name is YHWH which YH is breathe in and WH is breathe out. We are saying Gods name every time we breathe. Even non believers are saying Gods name and they don't even realize it.

As you start to experience with different breathing exercises, you start to notice how the mind changes because different airflows creates different neurological pathways. 

If you’re right handed through certain breath work you can activate your left hand more. So we want to be conscious and balanced on the left and the right side of the body. 

So breathing through the right nostril, 

breathing through the left nostril, 

through the upper parts, 

lower parts, 

the sides, 

breathing into different organs, 

breathing into the heart itself.

In your mind image breathing into the whole of your being. Being aware of that you will strengthen your awareness so the more your awareness becomes expanded, the more you expand into your consciousness. 

Then you start becoming more aware with clarity. 

Constant breath work such as practicing deep inhales into the spine has proven to reverse scoliosis to a degree. Some also stated that they have a height increase of up to 2 whole inches. 

I practice oxygen saturation before I start my day, meditations, working out, even just randomly through out the day.

Oxygen saturation is a measure of how much hemoglobin is currently bound to oxygen compared to how much hemoglobin remains unbound. At the molecular level, hemoglobin consists of four globular protein subunits. Each subunit is associated with a heme group.



I have since only been using this method of breathe work. All you do is take a long deep inhale through the nose and hold for 2 seconds, then dump all the air as fast as possible through your mouth and repeat 10 - 50 times. 

You will feel extremely light headed, ears may start to ring. Doing this right before starting meditation, going to sleep, working out, you will feel the difference.



There’s so much science supporting how injurious it is to constantly be breathing through your mouth.

There’s no debate about that but what people don’t realize is 25% to 50% of the population habitually breathes through their mouth.

They don’t realize the neurological problems that this causes, 

respiratory problems,

Snoring,

sleep apnea, 

metabolic disorders, 

the list goes on and on. The nose is the most amazing organ and no one talks about it at the NIH, there is no school for studying the nose and that is criminal.

People don’t realize how fast the damage comes through mouth breathing. It can literally change the structure of your face. You see these kids with long faces and it’s so common they call it adenoid face.

What is adenoid face?

Adenoid facies refers to the atypical appearance of facial features, and can result from persistent adenoid hypertrophy. Commonly, adenoid facies is known as “long face syndrome”, and is characterized by a long, lean face with an open mouth.

Breathing through the mouth so long that their faces, the musculature and the skeleton structure change creating a long face, it makes these people high risk to snoring and sleep apnea

The Lucid Meditation

This meditation is the most powerful meditation you can learn because it is the gateway to so many astral abilities.

This meditation requires you to lay on your back and it is easiest with a pillow under your legs. If you struggle getting into this lucid state, doing it on the carpet with something under your legs and neck would be an easier route to go because of how it keeps your spine straight allowing energy to flow easier.

In some cases if your bed is too soft this may be a harder meditation to get into. Now to do this lucid meditation all you’re doing is lay on your back and in your mind you are focusing on not moving any forms of your body, you are just staying as still as possible focusing on not moving at all.

The longer you stay in this state, what happens is the neurons stop firing and eventually you’ll get to this sensation over your entire body, a pulling sensation and this is your energy, your a etheric body your astral body.

There are so many things you can do in this state but the point of this meditation is to get into that pulling sensation and hold it for as long as you can. Practicing this lucid meditation before you go to sleep or falling asleep in the state is what they talk about lucid dreaming which I will get into in the next chapter.



Spotlight Meditation

The first thing you wanna do is get into a comfortable position, you’re able to do this laying down or sitting whatever makes you feel comfortable.

Now imagine from your minds eye a spotlight. 

What your going to do is spotlight a specific part of the body

whether it’s your left foot,

right pectoral muscle,

your bicep, 

the back of your thigh. 

Now the key here is to hold this spotlight consistently for at least 10 to 20 seconds in random positions on your body and the main thing here is for you to control where your minds eye is illuminating as a spotlight on your body.  

Doing this for a long period of time you eventually will reach a sensation where ever you are spotlighting, you will feel a tingle sensation like pins and needles. Now by doing this you are in control and telling your mind what to do training your thought process to follow your lead appose to you reacting to what's unfiltered.  

Getting into these elements of controlling your thought process will help you significantly in so many ways because your thoughts are no longer running rampant but you are actually doing an exercise to control your thoughts and this is also the main meditation that is used for learning how to remote view which I will explain in that lesson later on. 

This meditation is a technique to teach you to experience your own inner energy. 



River Meditation

This technique is how you can get into extremely deep states of meditation. I don’t often do it by itself however, just to learn the sensation of it and then using it in another form of lucid meditation helps dramatically.

Now imagine a flowing river that is winding in random ways and basically you’re in this river getting pulled by the current. Your are not resisting this river at all you’re just letting yourself go, letting yourself flow in the river freely. 

Its that simple, Try your best to not deviate from the flow, if thoughts filter back its normal just make sure you get back to the river.



Thread Spinner Meditation 

If you haven’t seen what a thread Spinner looks like click this link. 

https://youtu.be/h3h9Jnpd_OM

You pull it back-and-forth and it spins a gismo in the middle faster and faster every time you pull it. It goes faster when you pull it and when your hands get closer it slows down, pull again and it goes fast again. Picture this in your mind and imagine the energy in the middle of your body rotating like a thread spinner.

Follow it with your breathe when it goes back-and-forth, as you’re expanding your breath you’re spinning your energy faster and faster and you’re going to keep imagining this and your energy and you will start to amplify. 

Now stacking this in your lucid state is going to be an experience you'll never forget. Its a difficult thing that I can’t necessarily convey because I don’t really know how to explain it but practice a few times and you'll experience it for yourself. 



The Inception Meditation 

Now this by far is one of the craziest meditations that I’ve ever done with my body and mind. It takes a really high level of focus to do so but I believe that through you practicing these meditations you could easily get here.

This is when you get into the lucid state and you’re in that pulling sensation, you combine the spotlight meditation with the flowing meditation and the thread Spinner meditation and you try to do all 3 while you’re in the lucid state. If you practice these, your mind will go places. It is still by far the hardest meditation that I still do till this day and I do fail often but that is the challenge and why I continue to try to do it.

I have even been in the lucid state where I was imagining energy exploding into my chest and my body absorbing it. Within a few moments I started feeling a sensation of tapping my chest every time I imagined the energy hitting me and it felt like ice spreading over my body. I was doing this to just absorb energy, just experimenting. Its what lead me to all these other methods of meditation.





Manifestation

"The mistake so many of us make is we look for evidence outside ourselves. We slip into an unconscious, habitual, conditioned way of being. We forget: if we want to draw an experience to us, we can’t look for it. We have to become it." - Dr. Joe Dispenza

The universe always gives you exactly what you asked for if you ask with conviction. 

This is why people get stuck in their head because of what they’re experiencing so they’re constantly manifesting the negativity of what they’re enduring. We are constantly manifesting however we feel in our head is what creates our reality and it creates what you experience. This is a feedback loop of a carnal mind.

I always talk about being a slave to your convictions and not your emotions. Having conviction is the most important part of manifesting. I need you to fully understand the meaning of conviction. 

People That have the belief that they will acquire something have a harder time getting there because the element of belief is the absence of knowing so if you believe you will get there understand the doubt that comes with that subconsciously. 

Best example is do you know that your parents are your parents or do you believe that they are your parents? Either way I’m certain that you would act different in either of those two situation around them or in general. So knowing that they are your parents your actions are derived from a different element a high level of conviction. 

What is the meaning of conviction?

"A state of being free from doubt," conviction applies especially to a belief strongly held by an individual.

Conviction equals knowing:

Knowing is made up of 3 things: 

Believing it will happen

Expect it to happen

Seen it happen before. 

This is why I say be mindful of your thoughts, we daydream all the time and dwelling on the past constantly is a waste of energy because you could be using that same energy to manifest what you want. 

This is also why I recommend you making a vision board. 

If you cant have a constant vision of who and what you want then all your left is the past and its easy to dwell on the negative things. 

This is why we see people depressed or have anxiety. They have to much going on in there head with uncontrolled thoughts so all they can do is react. 

This is called cause and effect. Input is to high causes a reaction. 

Reduce the input by controlling your thoughts allows you to create. whatever has your minds eye will become your reality.





Vibrational Frequency

Etheric:

Relating to the heavens or a spiritual world or plane of existence.  

Souls exist in the vast domain diversely referred to by mystics and theologians as the etheric realm, heaven, or the afterlife.

Practicing the lucid meditation you will undoubtedly experience an out of body situation where you are navigating wherever you are in your etheric body and with this you are able to freely wander this realm based on your vibrational frequency. 

I will explain further in this lesson.

Your hair is an extension of your nervous system. Hair is also a unlimited organ but it most definitely a sense. It’s an antenna, the body scans environment by the way of hair. You have the hair on the outside of your body, you also have hair on the inside of your body. 

You have Merkel discs that’s how you get goosebumps or the hair stands up on you. 

The Merkel disc is a main type of tactile end organ for sensing gentle touch and is essential for sophisticated sensory tasks, including social interaction, environmental exploration, and tactile discrimination.

Your skin which is the true 6th and 7th sense is very familiar with everything that’s going on around you. Looking at it from a scientific point they say we’re looking at the universe through a peep hole. A peep hole that you put a key through so if you’re looking, you’re only going to see what that peep hole allows you to see but there’s different frequencies and vibrations and that's what we’re gonna call CO2 constituents which is nothing but light and vibration, that’s where all things truly exist.

CO2 constituents, carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO 2) is a chemical compound made up of molecules that each have one carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. In the air it is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas.



So like a dog whistle, you can blow that dog whistle all day but can we actually fully hear it?

No but it wakes up the neighborhood dogs and they start barking showing that their are frequencies on such a high sensitive level that we’re not in tune to anymore.

At 19 hertz human hearing disappears, we can’t hear anything below that. 

Its said that fear frequency is 19 hertz so a lion has it within a roar but they also put it within movies and things of that nature. You might be a grown man watching a scary movie wondering why you are shivering. It’s not that your heart fears it, it’s literally sending a frequency.

They call it the ghost frequency. You can’t hear it but you can feel it and that’s what creates the differentiation between your senses like there’s something there you can’t see it but you feel it so your body is jumping trying to figure out what’s happening.



Ghost frequency, the phenomenon of the missing fundamental frequency, often referred to as the Ghost Frequency, is the perceived pitch of a harmonic complex when the complex does not contain the pitch frequency itself. The base frequency, which is the pitch that is perceived, is absent from the harmonic complex.



This ghost frequency is within the frequency of of the movies so the whole time you’re on a low vibration, you’re being fearful and right now we’re in the belly of the beast 

which is built on fear,

this country is built of fear,

the marketing is built a fear,

everything is built off of fear, 

If I can keep you on that fear frequency I can control you but if you ascend beyond that height, beyond the beast frequency to your higher self and that’s when you can heal. That’s when you can live above it and the best way to start that is the food that you eat.

Eating high frequency foods.

This is honestly why I got into health. If we start with the food this is the fastest way of opening up Pandora’s box when it comes to healing holistically spiritual mind and body.





Remote Viewing

1 DISCUSSION

Government level remote viewing is one of the most craziest things you can use with your minds eye.

Remote viewing and actually seeing what you want to see requires input decompression for long periods of time.

Decompression, to release from pressure or compression. To convert (something, such as a compressed file or signal) to an expanded or original size. intransitive verb. : to undergo release from pressure especially : relax need a week off to decompress.

Input is to high when you watch television,

listen to music, 

talk to a lot of people,

be on your phone too much,

but don't let that stop you.

Remote viewing what you want to see becomes extremely difficult because you have too much input. It was very hard for me to see what I wanted to see until I had given away my gaming set up and then at that point it was a lot easier but if you want to achieve a level of being able to see whatever you want it requires you to eliminate a lot of things in your life for a period of time.

Decompress the things you look at visually so you can use that energy to manifest what you want to see, who you want to see.

I want you to understand that in the remote viewing documents at the end of this web course it talks about how they used this to spy on people. I understand this could be missed used in the wrong hands but I feel like it doesn't matter at this point.

The simplest way to get to a remote viewing state is the spotlight meditation inside the lucid state.

When you’re in the lucid meditation and you start to do the spotlight meditation, as you are switching your minds eye to spotlight to different parts of the body and you start to experience that sensation of pins and needles wherever your spot light is looking. 

You eventually bring the spotlight to your minds eye and even though your eyes are closed you should see a ball of light and I’m sure during any forms of meditation you may have experienced that light even though your eyes are closed, sometimes it can be so bright it’s like someone shining a flashlight in your eyes and you just wanna open your eyes even though you know your eyes are closed 

That light is your energy, now when you get to the state where your minds eye is spotlighting your minds eye and you start to experience that ball of energy, at that point when you see that light you have to grab the light mentally 

As you’re grabbing it imagine trying to condense the ball of light as small as you can and as you start to do that imagine trying to push your face through it like you’re peering through the light as focused as you possibly can. 

As you get to that state of trying to peer into the light you will actually start to see things randomly 

I have often found myself watching people in grassy fields in places that are unknown to me but in a couple of rare experiences I was able to look at specific people that I gave a really strong willed intent on seeing.

Having no idea where they were when I started my remote viewing after I knew exactly where they were. I even verified it by calling them afterwards and that’s when I realized that this is the government level remote viewing and I had figured out a way to experience it.





Lucid Dreaming

3 DISCUSSIONS
3DISCUSSIONSEnable fullscreen
When your body falls asleep it goes through cycles. In1975 lucid dreaming was scientifically recorded. 

Evidence shows based off of experience it’s like traveling to different worlds in correspondence with other cultures and in Egyptian mythology you’re tapping into other dimensions. 

The whole point of remembering your dreams what people don’t realize is you communicating with the higher dimensions that exist

Sometimes when you dream you don’t remember your dream but the more you meditate, the more conscious you become in your unconscious mind and that is where the quantum realm of knowledge is, where you have access to unlimited amounts of information.

Your mind has three main different states consciousness,

the conscious mind,

subconscious mind, 

and the unconscious mind.

Doing the lucid meditation and then falling asleep in it is how you lucid dream. This is because you’re meditating into sleep and that meditation is what’s going to keep your mind slightly elevated in your consciousness as you slip into your unconscious mind.

When you really want to dream about something you are able to set intention through that lucid meditation and fall asleep in it and dream about what you want to dream about, this is what people talk about when they explain lucid dreaming but this lucid state can be used for so many things on so many different levels.

You can actually set intention to seek information as well as setting expectation to see the future or the past because energy moves through space and time which does not obey the same physics as our physical bodies that move through time in space. It is the same feeling you get experiencing déjà vu or you have a gut feeling that something bad is going to happen and it happens.

Déjà vu a feeling of having already experienced the present situation.

That is energy, energy is information, when you go to these different dimensions you touch energy and when you wake up you bring traces of those energies back with you.

When you’re asleep you touch these energies, you can even translate them into dreams as information and when you wake up you remember the dream and this is how you have premonitions.

I have had what id like to believe about 12 premonitions, dreaming the amount I have you can start to tell the difference of what your experiencing. I have had 6 come true to the most minute detail.





Healing with energy

Reiki, a healing technique based on the principle that the therapist can channel energy into the patient by means of touch, to activate the natural healing processes of the patient's body and restore physical and emotional well-being.

People that practice Reiki are able to heal the body with their hands, fix spiritual energy. They are able to align another persons energy amongst many other things.

This method of energy manipulation can be done by a persons as well as on your self through meditation simply by going into a lucid state and focusing on the point that is injured with the spotlight meditation, focusing on healing can accelerate healing process dramatically.

I have injured my back before doing deadlifts. In this situation I had hurt my back, what felt like worse than I ever have versus the first time putting me out for over three weeks. I actually focused on meditating in these states and was up within four days dead lifting again.

Referring back to the lesson on feeling your energy. Manipulating the energy around your hands can be used on others to heal. That is how Reiki is performed.

Not actually touching the individual but in other cases I've seen people do it with both methods, hands on and hands off.

My personal experience was me just scanning a friends body and as I slowly was going over her I could feel the displacements of her energy and when I was over her back I squeezed a displacement and though I wasn't touching her physically, I watched her back muscles clench. Then I just pressed it down to make it smooth and had strong thoughts of healing over her and the next day she called me saying she hasn't had energy like this in months. 

Though at the end of the day it could be all in her head, I will not deny the fact of actually feeling her energy and manipulating it.



Out of body experience (OBE)

Technically you leave your body every single night you dream your astral body, etheric body travels to multiple dimensions and you wake up by teleporting you back instantly.

Now having an out of body experience is essentially just cranking your level of consciousness to the highest whilst being in your sub/unconscious mind which will allow you to navigate this physical dimension in real time. 

I’m not fully sure the mechanics on how to explain how we experience it but teaching you how to do it is easier and from there you’re able to figure things out.

I do want to warn you, being conscious for these elements of actually feeling the sensation of you leaving your body will definitely be weird at first and possibly even frightening.

That's how it was for me and it scared me from trying for over two weeks until I was led into trying it again intuitively. 

It all starts in the lucid state and getting into deeper states of the lucid state, that pulling sensation. I assure you if you are doing any of the things that are up above this lesson you eventually will have an OBE experience it’s only natural for you to accidentally do this practicing the lucid mediation. 

That is exactly how I figured it out, when you’re in that pulling sensation you will eventually feel your legs start to go up and you will go upside down and be pulled out of your body. It’s not that you’re actually getting pulled out of your body, your astral body is in such a state that you’re able to slip out of your physical body and according to the Monroe institute it was required that you’re mind would have to be in hemispherical sync. 

I assure you, you will accidentally get there no matter what doing all of the above. 

Warning:

You may see things and the only way they can actually do you any forms of harm is if you are extremely fearful and in no cases can they really hurt you or kill you.

In my personal experience I have had elements where I’ve seen things multiple times. I’ve seen things in my room but I have learned to control the elements of my emotions and you are actually a lot more powerful than you can understand.

I only have a couple of instances where I actually was physically harmed but it was so subtle that it didn’t bother me.

I was more excited than anything. 

The craziest thing I experienced, I was attacked by a brown entity that left striations on my side as well as during certain premonitions I’ve had where I was held down by some thing and it wasn’t sleep paralysis it was something else and when I pulled myself out, when I woke up I had numbness where I was being held on my physical body. 

Ill never forget that. Though I was also in an element where I melted an entity in my dream and the sound it made was haunting but also since then I haven't had any encounters after that.

I look forward to these things now because I want to be strong in my inner body. I wont get there being a afraid, neither will you.





Empowerment

When a man is masculine, driven, visionary, powerful and also soft, loving, kind, excepting and at peace, that man is unstoppable. 

That man draws in from his emotional heart sensor the woman of his dreams, the money of his dreams, the health of his dreams and the life of his dreams because he’s connected to his higher self both the masculine in him and the feminine in him and he owns it.

When a male or female is trapped in either their masculine energy or their feminine energy it’s difficult to be centered in your heart.  It’s going to be very difficult to give or receive love because you don’t know how to. The love inside of you has been wounded. 

Life is supposed to be effortless, making money is supposed to be effortless, having relationships with people are supposed to be effortless but the system creates survival mechanisms that keep us from that space.

The easiest way to get out of these mechanisms is to just let it go.



A woman’s highest calling is to lead a man to his soul, to unite him with source

Her lowest calling is to seduce,

Separating a man from his soul and leave him aimlessly wandering.



A man’s highest calling is to protect women,

So she’s free to walk the earth unharmed.

A man’s lowest calling is to ambush and force his way into the life of a woman.



Sometimes in life when we put others before ourselves constantly, we lose ourselves. 

It’s like trying to rescue someone who is drowning only to be drowned yourself. 

Its important to constantly be focusing yourself. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t love others. When you focus on yourself you are able to heal, you’ll become lighter. You can really embody the in vision of YOU without the compromise of others. When you become who you’re truly meant to be you can heal others and help them in a way that is not detrimental to your self, your true self.

This is why solitude is so powerful.


The limitless potential that we all have within ourselves will bring pleasure to our presence. Understand that pain does not make people, 

love makes people.

Pain is inconsequential, it’s love that saves us. Most people would know that but they don’t have any love around them, people surround themselves with lies and deception from this artificial system. I only wish for people in the future to find someone who will morn them when they are gone. 

Just by finding that one person that would feel a loss for you, would have had to established a loving connection. 

The greatest version of you is not the,

“I can do anything version of you”

The greatest version of you is the disciplined version of you!

The greatest version of you is the version of you that has parameters.

I don’t do that, 

I don’t drink that,

I don’t go there with those people,

I am focused, 

I know what I’m supposed to do and that ain’t it,

I have to stay right here in what I'm doing,

it’s a version of you that has parameters.



Parameters, a numerical or other measurable factor forming one of a set that defines a system or sets the conditions of its operation.

it’s hard to grind,

it’s hard to be focus, 

it’s hard to stay motivated,

Finding your truth

You were born with unconditional free will, you must understand the importance of you being alive. 

Now I hope you understand what they are taking away from you. 

You understand more ancient knowledge,

you understand how magical you are now,

you understand that you are the shooting star, 

you understand that you are the star, 

it’s not hollywood,

they want you to look up,

they want you to look out, 

they want you to look at the stars,

they want you to idolize them,

but you need to idolize yourself, idolize your creator, you have the ability to perceive the embodiment of whatever you want good or evil, your creator blesses you with that, that’s how much love and trust he has for you.  

He said I am going to give you unconditional free will and he knows that his children will go back to him. \

We are blessed, you are blessed,

stop being down on yourself,

stop being depressed,

stop being mad, 

stop being bitter, 

stop being sad, 

stop being emotional, 

stop being so human, 

rise above it, 

rise above it and light up the creative side of your hemisphere.

If you really want to be transformed you have to live in intentional life. 

Most people don’t live their life, they accept their life and when you accept your life you are living on things that are not worthy of your time and effort and energy 

To go uphill you have to be intentional, no one ever wins up hill by accident, you’ve never read a book on accidental achievements, you have to be intentional with what you do and who you are.

I recommend you make a vision board and have it a spot that you'll see it everyday. If you cant have an accurate vision of the person you want to embody, what ever has your minds eye will have your energy. How you feel in your head literally creates your reality and the things you'll attract.

Buying a House With $5,000

3 DISCUSSIONS
3DISCUSSIONSEnable fullscreen
Doing this requires you to open 3 separate bank accounts at 3 separate locations 

Go to Bank 1 and get a secured loan with your $5000 

Secured loans are debt products that are protected by collateral. This means that when you apply for a secured loan, the lender will want to know which of your assets you plan to use to back the loan. The lender will then place a lien on that asset until the loan is repaid in full.

Bank 1 holds the $5000 as collateral and they give you a secured credit line of $5000, this doesn’t run your credit and the banks don’t check your paystub‘s to know how much money you make.

From here you withdraw all $5000 of your credit line maxing it out and you take that $5000 and you go to bank 3 and you deposit that money in a savings. 

Bank 2 is on hold for what comes next

Now every week from bank 3 you repay at least $1000 to the secured loan at bank 1. 

The whole point is to have consistent payments every single week. The reason why you want to try to pay everything back within the first month is so you don’t have to pay any forms of interest. 

Every week you’re re-paying your loan around $1000 and once the loan is paid back in full you'll re-start this process again, withdrawing all the money and depositing it in back in bank 3. 

What will eventually happen is bank 1 will see your payment history which is in good standing, they will also think that you’re making $1000 a week because they have not verified your paystub‘s.

Bank 1 will eventually give you the collateral back from the secured loan ($5,000). Your secured line of credit becomes a regular credit line and it didn't touch your credit to obtain it.

Now head to bank 2 with your $5,000 and repeat this same process that you did at bank 1 with the secured loan. 



Bank 1 

(Credit Line) Up to $5,000

Withdraw max ($5,000) and deposit into bank 3



Bank 2 

(Secured Credit Line) 

Collateral holding your original $5,000 giving you a (Credit Line) Up to $5,000)

Withdraw max (5,000) and deposit into bank 3



Bank 3

Savings balance ($10,000)

Every week repay balances at bank 1 and bank 2 any where between $1,000 to $2,000

Repeat process until bank 2 becomes a full credit line and collateral is returned.



Repeat this process every week and eventually your credit score is going to skyrocket as well as you being preapproved for higher loan amounts from each bank because of your good standing.

The whole point is to continuously do this and use your preapprovals to get up to $40,000 in a credit line at both bank 1 and bank 2 so you’re constantly withdrawing all of it to repay it back.

Once you max out your preapprovals you withdraw all that money which should be up to $85,000 because you’re $5,000 on top. Withdraw everything to bank 3 and apply for a mortgage loan.

Now at this point in time they will run your credit which you should be in really good standing. You will need paystub‘s. 

It doesn’t matter what you get approved for the whole point is just to get your first property because at that point in time after you acquire it, its easier to buy another property.

After you get approved for your mortgage, depending on what you were approved for, say your mortgage is $1900 a month and your house costs around $300,000, you put a down payment of $85,000 depending on your approval. 

You then apply for a home equity loan. 

A home equity loan (sometimes called a HEL) allows you to borrow money using the equity in your home as collateral. Equity is the amount your property is currently worth, minus the amount of any existing mortgage on your property. You receive the money from a home equity loan as a lump sum. 

Home equity loan is 30 years.

Getting this loan in most cases may take up to 6 months after acquiring a mortgage With this home equity loan you will be approved for up to 80% of the equity on your house which was close to your down payment and this loan will only cost you less than $200 more a month. 

You still have 2 outstanding loans for a total of $80,000. 

From here you can rent out your first property and use the (HEL) to repay most of your loans or you can use that money and apply for another mortgage. Become a property manager, eventually all that equity and or money you have made you can sell the properties and flip them, buy more rent more, what ever you feel comfortable with.

All you've done was use $5,000 as collateral and used the banking systems to buy a house. 

This process may be faster for some. Estimated time 3 months to about 1 year maybe in some cases a little longer even a little quicker. 

Doing this will greatly aid your credit score.





Crypto

3 DISCUSSIONS
3DISCUSSIONSEnable fullscreen
The current system that bridges payments is a very outdated system, like swift.

If you were to transfer money from one bank to another, it will take several business days.

Each bank will hold your money and try to make a 10 to 1 return on it before they give it to the next bank and if another bank doesn’t like the currency you were sending, they’ll make you pay a fee for currency exchange. There’s just a bunch of fees and by the time your money gets to the destination, multiple banks have gotten a return on your money at your expense.

With crypto such as coins like XRP using Ripple Net, you can send billions in 3 to 5 seconds with a transaction fee of 0.00001XRP. 

The way crypto works is it uses a network protocol to transfer value. Look at the internet for instance, there is a protocol (https://) and the the destination (ascend.embodimentcelestial.com)

Just like how the internet transfers information really fast, crypto networks transfer value.

I do encourage you to do your own research but this is why crypto will take over. It eliminates the use of banks but of course with anything corporate giants are going to fight to take control and regulate everything because they don’t want us having any power or in control of our own money.

My top holds are, 

XRP 

Quant

Algorand

H-bar 

Ethereum 

XLM

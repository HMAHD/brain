## Answer Key

1. The "Internet" is the global network connecting devices for communication, while "Things" are physical objects equipped with sensors and software to collect and exchange data. Together, they enable physical objects to communicate, share data, and perform tasks automatically.
2. Major challenges in IoT include security concerns (vulnerabilities), interoperability (lack of standardized protocols), data privacy (unauthorized access), and scalability (managing many devices). Other challenges include data management, reliability, power management, time to market, cost, and platform longevity.
3. An Embedded Software Developer's primary role in an IoT project is to develop the firmware and software that run directly on the IoT devices. This often requires skills in languages like C/C++ or Python and a strong understanding of embedded systems.
4. In the 20th century, computers were primarily seen as "brains without senses," meaning they processed data but didn't directly interact with the physical world. With IoT, computers gained "senses" through integrated sensors, allowing them to perceive and interact with their environment, making them more autonomous.
5. Interoperability in IoT refers to the ability of diverse devices and platforms from different vendors to communicate and work together seamlessly. This is crucial for avoiding vendor lock-in, which occurs when a system is reliant on a single vendor's proprietary technology, limiting flexibility and increasing costs.
6. A Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) exploits the unique manufacturing variations in silicon to generate a distinct, on-demand cryptographic key or identifier for a device. This eliminates the need for non-volatile key storage and provides a hardware-based root-of-trust, making it ideal for anti-cloning and lightweight authentication in cost-sensitive IoT nodes.
7. The key advantage of ECC over RSA for constrained IoT devices lies in its ability to achieve the same level of cryptographic strength with dramatically smaller key sizes and reduced computational requirements. This results in significantly less bandwidth and energy consumption, which is critical for resource-limited IoT devices.
8. Two key benefits of AI and IoT integration are smart analytics and predictive capabilities. AI can process the vast amounts of data generated by IoT devices to identify patterns, make intelligent decisions, and predict future events, leading to more efficient and autonomous systems.
9. Edge computing involves processing data closer to the source of data generation (the "edge" of the network), rather than sending all data to a central cloud. Its primary benefits include reduced latency for faster response times, decreased bandwidth consumption, and enhanced data privacy by keeping sensitive data localized.
10. Secure Boot focuses on establishing a "chain of trust" during device startup by verifying firmware signatures to ensure only authorized software is loaded, preventing tampering. A Trusted Platform Module (TPM), on the other hand, is a dedicated hardware component that provides secure storage for cryptographic keys and offers functions like measured boot and remote attestation, protecting sensitive data and identity throughout the device's operation.

Discuss their respective strengths, limitations, and security challenges, and explain how their selection depends on specific use case requirements like range, power, and data rate.
3. Compare and contrast "Edge Computing" and "Fog Computing" within the context of IoT architectures. Explain how both extend traditional cloud infrastructure, detailing their unique contributions to data processing, latency reduction, and bandwidth optimization. Provide examples of scenarios where each approach would be most beneficial.
4. IoT projects involve a variety of specialized roles for computing professionals. Choose three distinct roles (e.g., Embedded Software Developer, Data Analyst/Data Scientist, Security Specialist) and for each, describe their responsibilities, the essential skills required, and how they contribute to the overall success and functionality of an IoT solution.
5. The "Genesis of IoT" is marked by a specific shift in connectivity. Discuss this historical turning point and explain how the fundamental definition of IoT (Internet + Things) contributes to this evolution. Furthermore, identify and explain at least three "practical issues" that arise from this widespread connectivity, drawing upon concepts of scalability, interoperability, and data management.

"Things" are physical objects equipped with technologies like sensors and software, enabling them to collect and exchange data over the Internet. The core goal of IoT is "Connecting the Unconnected," aiming to link physical objects not currently part of computer networks so they can communicate and interact with people and other objects. The age of IoT began in 2008-2009, when more 'things' became connected to the Internet than people.
- **What are the main practical challenges associated with IoT deployment?**
- Several practical issues arise in IoT deployment. **Security and Privacy** are paramount due to vulnerabilities in connected devices, risks of unauthorised data access, and the need for robust solutions from hardware to end-user applications. **Scalability** is a significant concern, requiring solutions to support functionality and performance for potentially hundreds of thousands of units and the ability to distribute processing, storage, and communication loads. **Interoperability** is challenged by the heterogeneity of IoT devices, requiring cross-vendor compatibility, support for multiple communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP), data standardisation (e.g., XML, JSON), and open APIs to avoid vendor lock-in. Other critical challenges include **Data Management and Storage** for the large volumes of data generated, ensuring **Reliability and Availability** of both hardware and software, efficient **Power Management** for devices, **Time to Market** for rapid development, **Cost** implications for large-scale deployments, and building **Stability and Credibility** for IoT platforms and providers.

This is ideal for applications requiring immediate responses or those with strict data privacy requirements.
- **Fog Computing:** Extends the cloud to the network edge, creating a distributed computing paradigm that sits between the IoT devices and the cloud. Fog nodes act as intermediaries, performing **data filtering**, **local processing**, and then selectively **uploading to the cloud**. It's a more distributed network of small data centres or nodes that bridges the gap, offering capabilities beyond just device-level processing but not as centralised as the full cloud.
- **What are some emerging trends and the predicted future for IoT?**
- The IoT landscape is continuously evolving with several key emerging trends and predictions for the future:
- **AI and IoT Integration:** Combining AI with IoT for smart analytics, predictive capabilities, and AI-driven intrusion detection.

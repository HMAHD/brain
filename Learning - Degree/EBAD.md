# Paper 01

1) D is an organization that operates in the arts and crafts industry in SL country. D was started by a renowned artist more than 5 decades ago and has grown over time to include several art galleries in SL country as well as two galleries in other countries of the region where SL country is situated in. A key activity of D is to support artists and craftsmen find the optimum markets for their unique creations and enabling buyers from different backgrounds with different requirements to purchase these creations by operating as an intermediary. Buyers and sellers generally meet at the galleries owned by D for this purpose where sellers receive the opportunity to be exposed to many buyers in order to sell to the highest offeror present at the location. D however feels that they could expand the business by reaching a much wider clientele (both buyers and sellers) through the use of technology as an enabler.

a) What type of software would help D achieve his goal? (3 marks)
==**Online auction platform** – a web and mobile system that hosts time-bound listings where the highest bidder wins, mirroring D’s existing “sell to the highest offeror” model but at global scale.==

b) Explain few fundamental features of such a software (8 marks) 

| ==Feature==                             | ==Why It Matters to D==                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ==Item Listings with rich media==       | ==Artists upload photos, videos, descriptions, start price, reserve price. Vital for showcasing one-of-a-kind pieces to remote buyers.== |
| ==Real-time Bidding Engine==            | ==Supports standard, proxy, and “buy-now” bids; shows live bid history and countdown timer so buyers feel the auction-room urgency.==    |
| ==Secure Payments & Escrow==            | ==Integrate PayPal, Stripe, cards, local wallets; hold funds until artwork ships to protect both sides.==                                |
| ==User Accounts & Reputation==          | ==Separate buyer/seller dashboards, ratings, KYC checks to build trust in a market of unique goods.==                                    |
| ==Advanced Search & Filters==           | ==Let collectors zero in on medium, style, price range, auction end-time, or creator.==                                                  |
| ==Analytics Console==                   | ==Track views, conversion rates, hot categories; artists see performance, D spots trends for curation.==                                 |
| ==Mobile-First Design & Push Alerts==   | ==Bidders get “you’ve been outbid” pings anywhere, driving higher final prices.==                                                        |
| ==Shopping Cart for Fixed-Price Items== | ==Enables parallel “gallery store” sales alongside auctions.==                                                                           |
| ==Anti-Fraud Controls==                 | ==Shill-bid detection, IP monitoring, two-factor login, and manual review flags.==                                                       |
| ==Multilingual & Multi-currency==       | ==Essential for cross-border reach beyond Sri Lanka.==                                                                                   |
c) Explain few monetization approaches of such a system (5 marks) 

| ==Model==                     | ==How D Could Apply It==                                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ==Commission on Sales==       | ==Take, say, 10–15% of the hammer price; aligns revenue with auction success.==       |
| ==Listing / Insertion Fees==  | ==Charge small upfront fee or tiered packages (basic free, premium placement paid).== |
| ==Subscriptions==             | ==“Pro Seller” plans with lower commissions, bulk uploads, or analytics extras.==     |
| ==Premium Visibility==        | ==Sellers pay to feature pieces on homepage, in newsletters, or at auction top.==     |
| ==Buyer’s Premium==           | ==Add 3–5% surcharge to winning bid (common in fine-art houses).==                    |
| ==Display Advertising==       | ==Run relevant craft-supply or framing ads in non-intrusive slots.==                  |
| ==Payment-Processor Rebates== | ==Negotiate a share of gateway fees due to high transaction volume.==                 |

a) Mention five (5) benefits of e-business and five (5) inherent limitations e-business (10 marks) 

## Key Benefits

1. **Global reach** – an online storefront is instantly visible to shoppers worldwide, opening markets that were impossible to serve from a single physical location.
2. **Always-on availability** – customers browse and buy 24 × 7, so revenue isn’t capped by store hours.
3. **Lower operating costs** – no prime-location rent, smaller payroll, and fewer utility bills translate into leaner overheads.
4. **Better customer experience** – personalized product suggestions, friction-free checkout, and self-service order tracking delight users and keep them coming back.
5. **Process automation** – inventory updates, invoicing, and support chat-bots run automatically, boosting accuracy and freeing staff for higher-value work.
6. **Real-time analytics** – dashboards show traffic, conversion, and stock levels the moment they change, enabling quick, data-driven decisions.
7. **Enhanced competitiveness** – nimble digital players can undercut, out-market, or out-innovate larger brick-and-mortar rivals.
8. **Built-in flexibility** – cloud platforms, plug-in ecosystems, and agile marketing let firms pivot products or campaigns in days rather than months.
## Inherent Limitations

1. **Security risks** – hackers target payment data and personal information, so ongoing investment in encryption, compliance, and monitoring is mandatory.
2. **Technical fragility** – site outages, slow load times, or payment-gateway failures can halt sales instantly and erode trust.
3. **Impersonal feel** – the lack of face-to-face interaction can hurt relationship-based sales and make it harder to convey brand warmth.
4. **Up-front and recurring costs** – building a robust site, integrating logistics, and paying for hosting, security, and updates require continual budget.
5. **Intense online competition** – low entry barriers mean countless rivals fight for the same keywords and ad space, forcing constant optimization of price, service, and marketing.
6. 
b) State some reasons why online shoppers drop out in the middle of their online journey. (5 marks) 
6. ==Just browsing / no purchase intent (≈58%).==
7. ==Extra costs revealed late (shipping, tax) (≈48%).==
8. ==Forced account creation (≈24%).==
9. ==Long or confusing checkout (≈17%).==
10. ==Hidden fees / poor cost transparency (≈16%).==
11. ==Site errors or crashes (≈13%).==
12. ==Limited payment options (≈9%).==
13. ==Cannot see full order total up-front.==

- ==Clear contracts and KPIs bind providers to common outcomes.==
- ==Continuous-improvement governance keeps cost, risk, and quality in balance.==
    
==_Benefits_==
- ==**Accountability** – providers know they are measured on end-to-end results.==
- ==**Cost optimisation** – avoids duplicate management effort.==
- ==**Risk spreading** – no vendor lock-in; best-of-breed mix.==
- ==**Higher quality & control** – unified reporting and escalation paths.==
    
## ==Three SIAM governance roles==

1. ==**Strategic** – sets vision, sourcing strategy, high-level policies.==
2. ==**Tactical** – designs processes, defines SLAs, manages continual improvement.==
3. ==**Operational** – day-to-day coordination, incident & change management across suppliers.==

| ==**Hosted payment gateway**== | ==Checkout sends the shopper to the gateway’s site (e.g., PayPal, Stripe-Checkout) for card entry, then returns to the store. All card data is stored and processed by the gateway, not the merchant.== | ==- **Pros:** fast to set up; shifts PCI-DSS compliance and fraud risk to the provider.  <br>- **Cons:** less branding control, extra click/redirect can hurt conversion; limited layout customisation.==        | ==A craft seller using Shopify chooses PayPal Express Checkout.

a) Mention two types of Inventory Management Systems and explain why an organization might select each typе. 
- ==On-premise==  
    ==– Software is installed on the company’s own servers.==  
    ==– Chosen when a firm needs total data ownership, deep customisation, or must meet strict internal / industry security rules.==  
    ==– Up-front hardware and IT costs are higher, but there are no ongoing vendor subscription fees, so long-run spend can level out.==
    
- ==Cloud-based==  
    ==– Accessed through a browser; the vendor hosts the servers and software.==  
    ==– Selected for real-time stock visibility, anywhere/any-device access, and minimal IT overhead (updates, backups, and security patches handled by the provider).==  
    ==– Scales easily with business growth and supports better forecasting because data flows live into analytics dashboards.==

# Paper 02

D is a department store in SL country inaugurated in 1990 by an enterprising former fashion executive E who used to work in a large textile manufacturing chain with its own brand. After the brand was sold to a foreign company, E started a retail store in a small town and with time, the brand grew to be the largest store in the town with customers also in nearby towns. D is also known across the country due to their television and radio advertisement and the name of the town has become synonymous with the textile store. E however feels that there is a significant number of potential customers across the country that are not able to purchase from D because of geographical barriers in spite of being aware of the brand and the very nature of the textile business. Having felt the need even more with the pandemic, E has now decided to invest in technology to expand the business and has employed you as a consultant to support the realization of this need. 
a) What type of software would help D to overcome the problem? (2 marks) 
 **==a) Software to Break Geographical Barriers==**
- ==Deploy a **full-featured e-commerce platform** (web storefront / B2C portal).==
- ==Core deliverables: online catalogue, secure checkout, order-management dashboard, customer-service tools.==
- ==Outcome: D’s unique arts and crafts can reach buyers nationwide without relying on physical galleries.==

b) Explain few best practices of designing a software for the above purpose. (10 marks) 
1. ==**Fast, Friction-Free UX**==  
    ==– Keep page loads under 2 s.==  
    ==– Let shoppers zoom, rotate, and view items in context.==
2. ==**Intuitive Shopping Cart**==  
    ==– Place cart icon top-right, show live item count.==  
    ==– Mini-cart pop-ups cut context switching.==  
    ==– Flag free-shipping thresholds early.==
3. ==**Transparent Costs & Flexible Payments**==  
    ==– Show taxes, shipping, and fees up-front.==  
    ==– Offer cards, wallets, bank transfers, and COD where relevant.==
4. ==**Streamlined Checkout**==  
    ==– One-page or step-by-step wizard, clearly numbered.==  
    ==– **Guest checkout** mandatory—no forced sign-up.==
5. ==**Mobile-First Design**==  
    ==– Responsive layouts, touch-friendly buttons, mobile wallets (Apple Pay / GPay).==
6. ==**Social Proof & Reviews**==  
    ==– Surface star ratings and customer photos; aim for ≥4-star average.==
7. ==**Personalisation Engine**==  
    ==– Real-time recommendations driven by browsing and purchase history.==  
    ==– Dynamic banners for return visitors.==

c) State some reasons why people drop out in the middle of their online shopping journey. (5 marks) 
- ==Hidden costs at checkout (tax, shipping).==
- ==Account creation walls.==
- ==Slow or complex checkout flow.==
- ==Too few payment choices.==
- ==Site errors or crashes.==
- ==“Just browsing” behaviour.==

==Mitigate by surfacing costs early, enabling guest checkout, adding gateways, load-testing the site, and retargeting casual browsers.==

d) What are the benefits an organization received by customizing the shopping experience? (4 marks) 
- ==Higher conversion rates and revenue uplifts.==
- ==Stronger loyalty—customers feel understood.==
- ==Better satisfaction scores; fewer complaints.==
- ==Data-driven insight for product and marketing decisions.==
- ==Reduced support load via smoother returns/exchanges.==
- ==Lower bounce rate—visitors stay and explore.==

e) How can organization customize the shopping experience? (4 marks)
- ==Serve **AI-driven product recommendations** on every page.==
- ==Offer made-to-order or configurable product options.==
- ==Send segmented, behaviour-based email nudges (welcome series, cart reminders).==
- ==Use “continuous shopping” cookies so shoppers resume where they left off.==
- ==Integrate AR tools (virtual try-ons, room visualisers) to mimic in-store interaction.==

==Implementing these points will transform D’s marketplace into a nationwide, high-performing online store that delights customers and scales revenue.==

a) Mention five features of a virtual office explaining how they add value to the company utilizing the virtual office infrastructure. (10 marks) 
1. ==Physical space on-demand – bookable meeting rooms or desks project a **professional image** for staff or client visits without paying year-round rent.==
2. ==Mail receiving & forwarding – a real street address improves **privacy and credibility**, keeps personal details off public documents, and ensures secure handling of parcels.==
3. ==Live answering (virtual receptionist) – scripted call-handling prevents missed leads, shields staff from distractions, and sustains a **“big-company” front-desk feel**.==
4. ==Pro-grade tele-/videoconferencing rooms – reliable equipment and quiet surroundings enable **high-quality virtual meetings**, widening hiring options and client reach.==
5. ==Virtual phone number – separates business from personal calls, preserves privacy, and reinforces a **consistent brand identity** across all channels.==

b) Mentions some benefits of online inventory management. (5 marks) 
- ==Cuts holding costs and frees working capital by matching stock to demand in real time.==
- ==Real-time dashboards record every movement the moment it happens, giving one accurate view of inventory.==
- ==Barcodes/RFID speed up picking and reduce mis-ships; multi-location tracking keeps sales channels in sync.==
- ==Live data feeds better demand forecasts, helping decide what to reorder, retire, or expand.==
- ==Fewer stock-outs and faster fulfilment raise customer satisfaction and loyalty.==
- ==Transactions flow straight into accounting, improving the accuracy of financial reports.==
- ==Cloud APIs snap together with e-commerce, shipping, and accounting apps, building an end-to-end tool-set without heavy IT lift.==
- ==Browser access lets scattered teams work on the same numbers anywhere, anytime.==

c) Compare and contrast OLTP and OLAP (10marks)
- ==**Purpose**==  
    ==– OLTP: lightning-fast capture and update of everyday transactions (e.g., ATM withdrawal).==  
    ==– OLAP: deep, multidimensional analysis of historical data for strategy (e.g., “which region grew fastest last quarter?”).==
    
- ==**Typical users**==  
    ==– OLTP: frontline staff and customer-facing apps.==  
    ==– OLAP: analysts and managers doing BI and data mining.==
    
- ==**Data model**==  
    ==– OLTP: highly normalised relational tables, small recent data set, constant reads _and_ writes.==  
    ==– OLAP: denormalised/multidimensional warehouse, huge historical set, read-heavy.==
    
- ==**Query pattern & speed**==  
    ==– OLTP: simple record-level queries; sub-second response mandatory.==  
    ==– OLAP: complex aggregations across millions of rows; seconds to minutes acceptable.==
    
- ==**Storage & backup**==  
    ==– OLTP: modest size; continuous backups to protect live transactions.==  
    ==– OLAP: terabytes common; periodic backups suffice.==
    
- ==**Availability**==  
    ==– OLTP: must run 24 × 7 × 365 to keep commerce moving.==  
    ==– OLAP: high availability desirable but not mission-critical for every second.==
    

In short, OLTP keeps daily operations humming; OLAP turns accumulated data into insight for long-term decisions.


---
a) Explain the concept of localization. (5 marks) 
==Localization is the fine-grained adaptation of a product for **one specific locale**. Beyond translating words, it tunes every detail—dates, currency, icons, legal text, even business logic—so the experience feels native to local users. Typical adjustments include:==

- ==Numeric, date and time formats==
- ==Currency symbols and price displays==
- ==Keyboard layouts, sorting rules, and text direction==
- ==Colours, graphics and symbols that carry different cultural meanings==
- ==Local laws (tax, privacy, labeling) and business practices==  
    ==In some cases the whole user journey or screen layout must be re-thought to match local expectations (e.g., right-to-left menus for Arabic or GST workflows for India). The payoff is higher trust, better usability, and stronger market adoption.==

b) Explain five benefits of an online auction system. (5 marks) 
1. ==**Global, 24 × 7 reach** – buyers and sellers participate from anywhere, any time.==
2. ==**Transparent, automated process** – the platform logs bids, handles payments, notifies winners, and tracks shipments without manual effort.==
3. ==**Flexible auction controls** – sellers set start prices, increments, photos, and can extend or repeat listings easily.==
4. ==**Instant market feedback** – live bidding data tells sellers what artworks attract interest and at what price points.==
5. ==**Lower friction than physical auctions** – no crowd noise, travel, or scheduling conflicts; bidders enjoy a calm, web-based experience.==

c) Explain five benefits of service integration and management. (5 marks) 
1. ==**End-to-end accountability** – a single integrator measures all suppliers against unified KPIs.==
2. ==**Cost optimisation** – coordinated contracts and shared tooling cut duplicated effort.==
3. ==**Better risk management** – multiple providers reduce vendor lock-in and spread operational risk.==
4. ==**Greater flexibility** – organisations can plug in best-of-breed specialists as needs evolve.==
5. ==**Improved governance and quality** – common processes and reporting raise service consistency for end-users.==

d) Explain the following concepts with examples where irrelevant
==i) **White labelling**==  
==A retailer puts its own brand on goods made by an external manufacturer—e.g., a supermarket’s “store-brand” cereal produced by a separate factory. It boosts brand presence while avoiding production overhead.==

==ii) **Information portal**==  
==A single website that pulls content from many sources and gives users one doorway to everything they need. Think of a university’s student portal that merges timetables, fees, library search and announcements.==

==iii) **Forward auction**==  
==Classic “highest-bidder-wins” model: the seller lists an item, bidding starts at an opening price, and the hammer falls for whoever offers the most—like eBay art listings or surplus-asset auctions.==

==iv) **Payment gateway vs payment processor**==

- ==Gateway: the **entry/exit point**—captures a shopper’s card details and sends them onward, then returns approval or decline.==
- ==Processor: the **behind-the-scenes courier**—routes encrypted payment data between the shopper’s bank, card network, and the merchant’s bank, then moves the money.==  
    ==In short, the gateway gathers the data; the processor moves the funds.==
    

==v) **Bounce rate vs conversion rate**==

- ==Bounce rate: share of visitors who leave after a single page—no clicks, no actions.==
- ==Conversion rate: share of visitors who complete a goal (purchase, signup, etc.).==  
    ==Lowering bounce rate (by faster loads, clearer value, better design) usually raises conversion rate because more visitors stay long enough to act.==


---
a) Explain the two types of Inventory Management Systems and the reasons an organization might select each type. (4 marks) 
- ==**On-premise system**==  
    ==– Software sits on the company’s own servers—data never leaves the building.==  
    ==– Chosen when the firm needs tight data ownership, heavy customisation, or must satisfy strict internal/industry security policies. Up-front hardware and IT labour are higher, but there are no monthly SaaS fees once installed.==
    
- ==**Cloud-based system**==  
    ==– Accessed through any browser; the vendor hosts the servers, handles backups, patches, and upgrades.==  
    ==– Picked for real-time visibility from any location, automatic updates, minimal IT maintenance, and pay-as-you-grow pricing. Works well for teams that travel, operate multiple sites, or need quick deployment.==

b) Explain the following e-business types with one example for each. 
- ==**B2C (Business-to-Consumer)** – a company sells goods/services directly to individual shoppers.==  
    ==Example: online airline or cinema ticketing.==
    
- ==**C2C (Consumer-to-Consumer)** – private individuals trade with each other on a digital marketplace.==  
    ==Example: eBay’s auctions for second-hand collectibles.==
    
- ==**C2B (Consumer-to-Business)** – individuals offer products, services, or influence to businesses that pay them.==  
    ==Example: a photographer licensing stock photos to a company through Shutterstock.==

c) State five examples for B2B portal types (5 marks) 
1. ==Service portal (e.g., an insurer’s self-service claims hub).==
2. ==Supplier/vendor portal for RFQs and order tracking.==
3. ==Community portal that gathers industry professionals for peer support.==
4. ==Partner portal that gives resellers pricing, marketing assets, and tier rewards.==
5. ==Learning portal delivering courses, tests, and certifications to channel partners or customers.==

d) Explain the benefits of a B2B portal for a business and its collaborators. (10 marks)
==**For the business:**==
1. ==Scales sales and service without adding headcount.==
2. ==Automates workflows → higher process efficiency.==
3. ==Cuts operating costs by shifting transactions online.==
4. ==Expands brand reach and attracts fresh B2B leads.==
5. ==Provides cost-effective, always-on marketing.==
6. ==Differentiates the firm from slower competitors.==
7. ==Delivers rich analytics for demand forecasting and UX improvement.==
    
==**For collaborators (partners, vendors, customers):**==
8. ==Personalised dashboards raise satisfaction and loyalty.==
9. ==Built-in forums create a knowledge-sharing community.==
10. ==Real-time communication channels speed issue resolution.==
11. ==Enterprise-grade security safeguards sensitive data.==
12. ==Self-service access, mobile optimisation, and 24 × 7 availability let users place orders, download docs, or check status whenever they need—reducing their reliance on phone support and working-hour constraints.==

# Paper 03

D company is a children toys manufacturer in SL country. D was started 35 years ago by a carpenter with a passion for crafting that gradually grew to become a manufacturing company of different toy types with a set of its own retail stores. D is now run by the son of the founder and contains 3 manufacturing facilities; two in SL country and 1 in a neighboring country as well as 5 outlets in the two countries. The company also has 3 large warehouses which store manufactures good and items purchased for selling as the retail stores of D also stock items from other manufacturers for sales. D has a large staff in each of its locations to keep count of stock and to perform the purchasing and stock management function because keeping the right amount of each item at the right place at the right time has always been a costly problem for D; further aggravated by the increase of online toy stores. 

a) What type of system would help D improve its operations and value delivery process? 
==Implement an **Enterprise-grade Inventory Management System (IMS)** that spans factories, warehouses, and retail stores. A modern IMS consolidates purchasing, production, warehousing, and point-of-sale stock data in one real-time platform—precisely what D needs to know “what, where, and when” for 100-plus toy SKUs across multiple sites.==

b) What benefits would an organization have of this type of software? (10 marks) 
1. ==**Real-time visibility** – one dashboard shows stock levels and reorder points for all plants, warehouses, and outlets.==
2. ==**Lower carrying costs** – accurate demand forecasts slash over-production and dead stock.==
3. ==**Fewer stock-outs** – automated low-stock alerts trigger timely replenishment, protecting sales and customer loyalty.==
4. ==**Optimised warehouse space** – slotting algorithms place fast-movers up front, slow-movers in bulk, freeing floor area.==
5. ==**Faster order fulfilment** – pick-pack-ship workflows and barcode/RFID scanning cut lead times and mis-picks.==
6. ==**Integrated purchasing** – the system raises purchase orders automatically when safety stock thresholds are breached.==
7. ==**Unified reporting** – gross margin, turnover rate, aged inventory, and shrinkage reports feed straight into finance.==
8. ==**Regulatory & safety compliance** – batch/lot tracking traces each toy back to production run, essential for recalls.==
9. ==**Multi-channel readiness** – live stock sync with D’s online store so e-commerce customers only buy what’s actually available.==
10. ==**Labor efficiency** – fewer manual counts mean staff redeploy from tallying boxes to higher-value tasks like merchandising.==

c) Mention some features that are essential to make this type of software effective. (10 marks) 
1. ==Real-time SKU tracking across multiple locations.==
2. ==Automatic reorder point & safety-stock calculations.==
3. ==Demand forecasting with seasonality and promo-lift factors.==
4. ==Purchase-order management with supplier scorecards.==
5. ==Barcode/RFID integration for receiving, picking, cycle counts.==
6. ==Batch/lot & serial tracking for quality control and recalls.==
7. ==Transfer management between plants, warehouses, and stores.== 
8. ==Multi-channel inventory sync (brick-and-mortar POS + e-commerce).==
9. ==Mobile apps for floor staff (scan on any Android/iOS handheld).==
10. ==Role-based dashboards and exception alerts for managers==

d) Compare and contrast the on-premise and cloud-based versions of this software. (5 marks)

| ==Aspect==                          | ==On-premise IMS==                                                        | ==Cloud IMS==                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ==**Deployment**==                  | ==Installed on D’s own servers at HQ or factories.==                      | ==Hosted by vendor; accessed via browser/API.==                                   |
| ==**Up-front cost**==               | ==High: hardware, licenses, IT staff.==                                   | ==Low: subscription, minimal hardware.==                                          |
| ==**Control & customisation**==     | ==Full control; deep tailoring possible.==                                | ==Configurable but within vendor’s framework.==                                   |
| ==**Maintenance & updates**==       | ==D’s IT team applies patches, backups, DR.==                             | ==Vendor handles upgrades, security, backups automatically.==                     |
| ==**Accessibility & scalability**== | ==Local network; remote sites need VPNs; hardware expansion takes time.== | ==Accessible anywhere; scales resources on demand—ideal for seasonal toy peaks.== |

==**Bottom line:** On-premise suits firms demanding absolute data sovereignty and heavy custom code; cloud delivers faster rollout, lower IT burden, and easier growth—usually the better fit for a geographically spread toy brand like D.==

a) Mention five features of a Content Management System and how they add value to the CMS user. (10 marks) 
1. ==**Indexing & Search**==
    - ==The CMS catalogues every file, tag, and author, then lets users locate content instantly by keyword, date, or metadata.==
    - ==Value → saves staff time and ensures no asset “goes missing” in a deep folder maze.==
        
2. ==**Retrieval & Preview**==
    - ==Once a file is found, the system renders a quick preview (HTML, PDF, image, video) without extra downloads.==
    - ==Value → editors confirm they have the right item before opening or publishing it, reducing errors.==
        
3. ==**Format Management**==
    - ==Converts scans or legacy docs into web-friendly formats (e.g., Word → PDF/HTML) and optimises images for different screen sizes.==
    - ==Value → non-technical users publish consistent, accessible content without mastering design tools.==
        
4. ==**Revision Control (Versioning)**==
    - ==Tracks every change, shows who edited what, and allows roll-back to earlier versions.==
    - ==Value → protects against accidental deletions, supports audit trails, and simplifies team collaboration.==
        
5. ==**Template-based Publishing**==
    - ==Drag-and-drop or wizard-driven templates apply brand-approved layouts automatically.==
    - ==Value → any authorised employee can add pages that look professional and on-brand—no developer queue required.==

b) State some features of a B2B Portal (5 marks) 
- ==Buyer-specific catalogues with only the products relevant to that account.==

a) Explain the concept of internationalization. (5 marks) 
==Internationalization is the _design-time_ practice of building software or content so it can slip into **any language or culture with minimal re-work**.==  
==What it involves:==

- ==Removing hard-wired text and enabling Unicode so every script—Sinhala to Cyrillic—renders correctly.==
- ==Writing code that calls locale-aware libraries for dates, numbers, calendars, sorting and personal-name formats.==
- ==Separating all strings, images and culturally sensitive assets from source code so translators can swap them without touching logic.==
- ==Adding latent support for later needs such as right-to-left layouts, vertical text or bidirectional markup.==

==Done early, i18n slashes future localisation cost and time, avoids ugly retrofits, and opens global markets from day one.==

b) Explain the benefits of an information and service portal for an organization. (10 marks) 
1. ==One **self-service front door** speeds communication for staff and customers.==
2. ==Around-the-clock access lifts satisfaction and loyalty while cutting phone/email load.==
3. ==Integrated knowledge base means faster, more accurate answers—no data silos.==
4. ==Automated workflows reduce administrative cost and human error.==
5. ==Personalised dashboards improve user experience and keep people engaged.==
6. ==Centralised, secure data store strengthens governance and compliance.==
7. ==Real-time analytics reveal service bottlenecks and usage trends.==
8. ==Easy API/plug-in framework lets the portal grow with new apps or data feeds.==
9. ==Consistent branding and messaging raise organisational visibility.==
10. ==Employees feel empowered to solve issues independently, boosting productivity.==

c) Explain the following concepts 
==i) **Drop shipping** – The retailer lists products it never stocks; when a shopper orders, the third-party supplier ships directly to the customer. Retailer pockets the margin, supplier handles fulfilment.==

==ii) **Content Management System (CMS)** – Software that lets non-technical users create, edit, version and publish digital content via a user-friendly front end (CMA) while a back end (CDA) pushes the updates live.==

==iii) **B2B Portal** – Web or mobile workspace where companies transact and collaborate with other businesses, offering role-based catalogues, contract pricing, self-service orders and secure messaging.==

==iv) **Double auction** – Market mechanism (e.g., stock exchange) where many buyers post bids, many sellers post asks; the system finds a single clearing price so bids ≥ p buy and asks ≤ p sell.==

==v) **Payment gateway** – Front-end service that captures a customer’s card or wallet details online or at POS, passes the encrypted data to the payment processor/bank, then returns an approval or decline to the merchant.==

a) Explain the two types of Content Management Systems (by installation type) and the reasons an organization might select each type. (4 marks) 
==**On-premises CMS**==
- ==Software runs on the organisation’s own servers.==
- ==Picked when the business needs deep customisation, full control of plugins/themes, or must keep all data inside its own firewall (e.g., regulated sectors).==
- ==Examples: WordPress.org, Drupal, Joomla.==
    

==**Cloud-hosted CMS**==
- ==Vendor hosts the platform; users reach it via browser.==
- ==Chosen for rapid deployment, automatic upgrades, no server maintenance, and pay-as-you-go pricing. Custom code access is limited but most design work happens through visual editors.==
- ==Examples: Squarespace, Webflow, Wix, WordPress.com.==

b) Mention the benefits for an organization of having a web storefront. (6 marks) 
1. ==**Higher conversions** – fast pages and tailored product displays turn browsers into buyers.==
2. ==**Personalised journeys** – algorithms surface relevant items, lifting average order value.==
3. ==**SEO & performance gains** – clean, speedy front-ends rank better and cut bounce rate.==
4. ==**Omnichannel consistency** – the same look-and-feel across desktop, mobile app, and in-store kiosks.==
5. ==**Mobile revenue boost** – responsive design captures shoppers who research and buy on phones.==
6. ==**Trust via content & reviews** – rich media and user feedback build confidence, pushing hesitant visitors over the line.==

c) Mention some monetization approaches for online auction systems. (5 marks)
1. ==**Subscription plans** – recurring fees for listing privileges or buyer access tiers.==
2. ==**Freemium add-ons** – pay to unlock advanced analytics, bulk uploads, or featured placement.==
3. ==**Seller commissions** – percentage of each successful sale or insertion fees after a free allowance.==
4. ==**Payment-gateway kickbacks** – share of processing fees or financing revenue through partner gateways.==
5. ==**Display advertising** – banner or native ads targeted to the site’s bidding audience.==

d) Explain some features of a good sales management software
- ==**Pipeline view** – drag-and-drop stages show deal health at a glance.==
- ==**Built-in CRM** – central record of contacts, notes, and interaction history.==
- ==**Lead & opportunity tracking** – move prospects through qualification, proposal, close.==
- ==**Activity dashboards & leaderboards** – monitor calls, emails, demos, and rep rankings.==
- ==**Omnichannel comms** – native calling, SMS, and synced email in one tab.==
- ==**Automation rules** – auto-send follow-ups, assign tasks, or update fields when triggers fire.==
- ==**Customisable reports & forecasting** – real-time KPIs, territory charts, quota progress, and predictive revenue.==
- ==**Coaching tools** – call recording, scorecards, and feedback loops for rep development.==
- ==**Flexible configuration** – custom fields, pipelines, and workflows to match any sales process.==
- ==**Third-party integrations** – connect accounting, marketing-automation, CPQ, and support systems for a unified data flow.==

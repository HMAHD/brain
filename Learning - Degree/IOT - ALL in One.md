## Session 01

### What is IoT?

The term "Internet of Things" (IoT) is made up of two key concepts:

- **"Internet"**: This refers to the **global network** that connects millions of computers and devices, enabling them to communicate and be controlled remotely.
- **"Things"**: These are **physical objects** equipped with technology like sensors, software, and other components, allowing them to collect and exchange data over the Internet.

**Putting it together**: IoT means **connecting various physical objects ("things") to the Internet** so they can communicate, share data, and work together to perform tasks automatically or provide useful information.

**Goal of IoT**: The primary goal is **"Connecting the Unconnected"**. This means bringing objects not currently joined to a computer network into communication and interaction with people and other objects.

### Challenges in IoT

It's important to remember these four key challenges:

- **Security Concerns**: Vulnerabilities in connected devices.
- **Interoperability**: The lack of standardized protocols across different devices and systems.
- **Data Privacy**: Risks of unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### 1. Why IoT Security Matters

- **Massive Attack Surface**: By 2025, there will be over 30 billion IoT devices, creating a vast potential attack surface.
- **Real-World Impacts**: Notable breaches like Mirai (2016) and Verkada (2021) demonstrate the severe consequences of insecure IoT devices.
- **Critical Sectors**: IoT devices are integrated into critical sectors such as healthcare, energy, transport, and smart cities, making their security paramount to public safety and infrastructure stability.

### 2. IoT Threat Landscape

Threats can be categorised by their target:

- **Network-Level Threats**: Such as eavesdropping, rogue gateways, and routing attacks.
- **Cloud/Edge Threats**: Involve API abuse and supply-chain compromises.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Risks of sensor data inference and tracking.

### 3. Device-Level Security Technologies

These technologies establish a **"Root-of-Trust"** to ensure device integrity from the ground up:

- **Secure Boot & Firmware Signing (Root-of-Trust)**:
    - **Core Idea**: Verifies firmware at boot-up, ensuring only authorised firmware is loaded.
    - **How it Works**: An immutable boot ROM anchors trust, and the bootloader cryptographically verifies signatures at each stage. This creates a cryptographic chain-of-trust to the application, preventing tampered or rogue firmware.
    - **Typical IoT Use**: Fundamental for secure firmware updates.
- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM) & Secure Elements (SE)**:
    - **Core Idea**: A dedicated crypto co-processor that securely generates and stores private keys.
    - **Functionality**: Supports measured boot and remote attestation. Secure Elements are compact, low-power variants.
    - **Typical IoT Use**: Identity management, TLS operations, and anti-rollback protection.
- **ARM TrustZone / RISC-V PMP Isolation**:
    - **Core Idea**: CPU divides execution into Secure vs Non-Secure worlds, with hardware-enforced memory and peripheral access control.
    - **Benefit**: A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) hosts sensitive code.
    - **Typical IoT Use**: Ideal for payments, secure Over-The-Air (OTA) updates, and credential vaults.
- **Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) for Device IDs**:

        - **ChaCha20 stream cipher + Poly1305 MAC**: Favoured when **no AES hardware** is present, often running 30-40% faster in pure software than AES, while maintaining 128-bit security.
    - **ECC (Elliptic-Curve Cryptography) vs RSA**:
        - **ECC (e.g., Curve25519)**: Provides the same security strength as RSA with **dramatically smaller keys and signatures** (e.g., 256-bit ECC â‰ˆ 3072-bit RSA).
        - **Advantages of ECC**: Significantly reduced handshake bandwidth (over 80% cut) and computation time, saving energy.
        - **Use**: Preferred for TLS, firmware signing, and secure boot in IoT devices.

    - **FIDO Device Onboard (FDO)**: A zero-touch provisioning standard that securely binds a generic 'ownership voucher' to the customer's platform during installation, simplifying onboarding.
- **Post-Quantum Crypto Readiness**:
    - **Challenge**: Large-scale quantum computers could break RSA and ECC.
    - **NIST Finalists**: Kyber (Key Encapsulation Mechanism) and Dilithium (signature scheme) are lattice-based, future-proof standards.

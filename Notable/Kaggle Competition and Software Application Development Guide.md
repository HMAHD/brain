# Kaggle Competition and Software Application Development Guide

## 3. Prepare the Development Environment
- Set up a virtual environment
- Install necessary libraries:
  ```
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn flask
  ```

## 4. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Load and explore the dataset
- Handle missing values
- Perform feature engineering
- Encode categorical variables

## 5. Model Development
- Choose model: Random Forest (ensemble method)
- Split data into training and validation sets
- Train the model
- Evaluate model performance

## 6. Model Optimization
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV
- Consider feature selection techniques
- Iterate and improve the model

## 7. Make Predictions and Submit Results
- Make predictions on the test set
- Format the results according to competition guidelines
- Submit the results on Kaggle

## 8. Develop Software Application
- Create a simple web application using Flask
- Integrate the trained model into the application
- Design a basic HTML template for user input
- Implement prediction functionality

## 9. Test and Deploy
- Test the application locally
- Deploy the application on a platform like Heroku, vercel, aws, azure

## 10. Document and Share
- Write a README.md file with project details and instructions
- Push the code to a GitHub repository
- Include requirements.txt for easy environment setup

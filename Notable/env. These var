# env

## The warnings you're seeing indicate that several environment variables are not set in your Docker Compose environment. These variables are crucial for the proper configuration of your services. To resolve this issue, you need to create a `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml` file and populate it with the required variables. Here's how to address this:

1. Create a `.env` file:
   In your project directory, create a file named `.env`.

2. Add the following content to the `.env` file, adjusting the values as needed for your specific setup:

WEB_PORT=3000
API_HOST=http://api:4000
API_PORT=4000
API_DB=postgres://db:5432/your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_PORT=5432

3. Explanation of variables:
   - `WEB_PORT`: The port your web application runs on (e.g., 3000)
   - `API_HOST`: The hostname and port of your API service (use the service name from docker-compose)
   - `API_PORT`: The port your API service runs on (e.g., 4000)
   - `API_DB`: The database connection string for your API
   - `DB_USER`: PostgreSQL database username
   - `DB_PASSWORD`: PostgreSQL database password
   - `DB_NAME`: PostgreSQL database name
   - `DB_PORT`: PostgreSQL database port (default is 5432)

4. After creating and populating the `.env` file, try running your Docker Compose command again:

docker-compose up --build

This should resolve the warnings about unset variables.

If you're still encountering issues, double-check that:
- The `.env` file is in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml` file.
- There are no typos in the variable names in both the `.env` file and the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
- The values in the `.env` file are correct for your setup.

Remember, the `.env` file contains sensitive information, so make sure not to commit it to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore` file if you haven't already.

### Core Concept

The system uses **dual-sensor technology** (IR sensors + Camera) with **sensor fusion** to accurately count passengers in crowded Sri Lankan buses, addressing the specific challenge where simple IR sensors fail due to:

- Multiple people passing simultaneously
- People standing in doorways blocking sensors
- Extremely crowded conditions where passengers overlap

### How It Works

#### 1. **IR Sensor Subsystem**

- **Entry/Exit Detection**: Two IR sensors at bus doors
- **Real-time Counting**: Instant detection of passenger movement
- **Limitations Addressed**: Can miss counts when multiple people pass together

#### 2. **Camera Vision Subsystem**

- **Head Detection**: Counts actual heads using computer vision
- **Overhead Mounting**: Camera mounted on ceiling for best view
- **Processing**: Runs every 2 seconds to update count
- **Advantage**: Can see overlapping passengers and standing crowds

#### 3. **Sensor Fusion Algorithm**

```
IF sensors agree (within ±2 passengers):
    Use weighted average (70% camera, 30% IR)
ELSE (sensors disagree):
    In crowded conditions → Trust camera more (up to 90%)
    In light conditions → Balance both sensors
```

### Real-Time Data Flow

```
1. IR sensors → Instant detection → Update count
2. Camera → Process image (every 2s) → Head count
3. Fusion Algorithm → Combine data → Final count
4. Display Update → LCD shows status → Every 1s
5. Cloud Sync → Send data → Every 5s
6. Alerts → Overcrowding warning → <100ms response
```

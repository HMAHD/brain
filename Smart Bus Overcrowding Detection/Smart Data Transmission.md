- **Event-based**: Sends data when arriving/leaving stops, status changes
- **Camera validation**: Every 2 minutes (not continuous)
- **Regular updates**: Every 5 minutes as heartbeat
- **Efficient bandwidth**: Only sends when necessary

### 2. **When Data is Sent:**

```
1. Bus arrives at stop
2. Bus departs from stop  
3. Status changes (Normal ‚Üí Overcrowded)
4. Significant passenger change (¬±5 passengers)
5. Every 5 minutes (heartbeat)
6. Emergency alerts (immediate)
```

### 3. **Dashboard Features:**

- **Real-time map** with all buses
- **Color-coded status** (Green/Yellow/Red)
- **Active alerts** panel
- **Stop analysis** (crowding patterns)
- **Fleet overview** (all buses on route)
- **Historical data** for planning

### 4. **Additional Suggestions for Real Implementation:**

**A. Predictive Features:**

- Predict crowding at next stops
- Suggest alternate buses to passengers
- Alert control room about potential issues

**B. Passenger App Integration:**

- Show real-time occupancy
- Suggest less crowded buses
- Estimated arrival times

**C. Driver Features:**

- Audio alerts for overcrowding
- Suggested stop durations
- Route deviation alerts

**D. Analytics:**

- Peak hour patterns
- Stop-wise passenger flow
- Revenue optimization
- Fleet utilization reports

## About Your Circuit Design:

Your circuit looks good! Here's my assessment:

### ‚úÖ **Correct Elements:**

1. **I2C LCD connection** - Perfect
2. **Button pull-downs** - Good practice
3. **LED resistors** - Essential, well done
4. **Buzzer connection** - Correct
5. **Power distribution** - Looks organized

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Suggestions:**

1. **Add bypass capacitors** near ESP32 power pins (100nF)
2. **Consider external pull-up resistors** (10kŒ©) for I2C
3. **Add a power LED** to indicate system is on
4. **Label your potentiometers** (which is flow, which is accuracy)

### üí° **For Real Implementation Add:**

1. **GPS Module** (connects to Serial2)
2. **4G/LTE Module** for reliable data
3. **SD Card** for offline data storage
4. **Voltage regulator** (12V‚Üí5V for bus power)
5. **Camera module** (ESP32-CAM or USB camera)

The realistic system I provided is much more practical for actual deployment - it conserves power, bandwidth, and provides actionable data to fleet managers!

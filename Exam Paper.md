## Section A: Short Answer Questions (40 Marks)

**Question 1 (10 Marks)**  
Define an **information system** and briefly describe its four main components.

**Answer:**  
An **information system (IS)** is a structured combination of people, technology, processes, and data that collects, processes, stores, and distributes information to support decision-making and business operations.

**Components:**

1. **People:** Users and managers who operate and maintain the IS.
2. **Technology:** Hardware (e.g., computers), software (e.g., ERP systems), and networks.
3. **Processes:** Procedures for collecting, processing, and distributing data.
4. **Data:** Raw facts transformed into meaningful information.

**Question 2 (10 Marks)**  
List five reasons why information systems are essential for businesses today, providing one example for each.

**Answer:**

1. **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** IS provide real-time analytics for informed decisions (e.g., Amazon’s AI-driven recommendation system).
2. **Automation and Process Optimization:** Automate repetitive tasks to reduce errors (e.g., SAP ERP automates workflows for global corporations).
3. **Enhancing Customer Experience:** Support omnichannel engagement (e.g., Netflix’s personalized algorithms improve user experience).
4. **Cloud Computing and Remote Work:** Enable flexible operations (e.g., Airbnb uses cloud-based IS for global operations).
5. **E-Commerce and Supply Chain Transformation:** Improve efficiency with smart logistics (e.g., Walmart uses IoT for real-time stock tracking).

**Question 3 (10 Marks)**  
Explain the difference between **explicit knowledge** and **tacit knowledge**, with an example of each.

**Answer:**

- **Explicit Knowledge:** Documented, easily shared knowledge (e.g., a company manual detailing procedures for inventory management).
- **Tacit Knowledge:** Undocumented, experience-based knowledge residing in individuals’ minds (e.g., a manager’s intuitive understanding of customer preferences gained through years of interaction).

**Question 4 (10 Marks)**  
What is the purpose of a **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system? List three benefits and one real-world example.

**Answer:**  
**Purpose:** A CRM system captures, integrates, and analyzes customer data to enhance customer relationships and improve business outcomes.

**Benefits:**

1. Increases customer satisfaction and loyalty.
2. Reduces direct-marketing costs.
3. Provides insights into customer behavior.

## Section B: Descriptive Questions (30 Marks)

**Question 5 (15 Marks)**  
Describe **Porter’s Competitive Forces Model** and explain how information systems can be used to address each force. Provide an example for one force.

**Answer:**  
**Porter’s Competitive Forces Model** analyzes five forces that shape a firm’s competitive environment, and information systems (IS) help address each to gain a competitive advantage:

1. **Rivalry Among Existing Competitors:** IS provide competitive intelligence to differentiate products/services (e.g., real-time pricing analytics).
2. **Threat of New Entrants:** IS create barriers through proprietary systems or economies of scale (e.g., complex ERP systems).
3. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers:** IS strengthen supplier relationships via SCM systems (e.g., automated procurement platforms).
4. **Bargaining Power of Customers:** IS enhance loyalty through CRM systems (e.g., personalized offers).
5. **Threat of Substitute Products/Services:** IS enable unique offerings to reduce substitution (e.g., innovative product features).

**Example (Rivalry):** Toyota uses IS for innovation and operational excellence, offering superior quality and efficiency to outperform competitors.

**Diagram (Porter’s Five Forces):**  
[Central box: “The Firm (Rivalry Among Competitors)” with arrows from four boxes: “Threat of New Entrants,” “Bargaining Power of Suppliers,” “Bargaining Power of Customers,” “Threat of Substitute Products/Services.”]

**Question 6 (15 Marks)**  
Explain the **Knowledge Management Value Chain** and describe its four stages with one example for each stage.

**Answer:**  
The **Knowledge Management Value Chain** transforms raw data into usable knowledge through four stages, adding value at each step:

1. **Acquisition:** Gathering knowledge from documents, people, or systems.
    - **Example:** Collecting customer feedback data from surveys at Walmart.
2. **Storage:** Organizing knowledge in databases or document management systems.
    - **Example:** Storing employee training manuals in a SharePoint database.
3. **Dissemination:** Sharing knowledge via portals, wikis, or collaboration tools.
    - **Example:** Sharing best practices through a company wiki at IBM.
4. **Application:** Integrating knowledge into business processes and decision-making.
    - **Example:** Using demand forecasting data to optimize inventory at Walmart.

## Section C: Case Study and Application Questions (30 Marks)

**Question 7 (15 Marks)**  
You are starting a small courier service that delivers packages via motorbikes within a small geographical area. Discuss how your firm could become a **digital firm** and identify two specific information systems that could support this transformation.

**Answer:**  
A **digital firm** has significant business relationships enabled and mediated digitally, leveraging IS for efficiency and responsiveness.

**How to Become a Digital Firm:**

- **Digital Processes:** Use IS to manage orders, track deliveries, and communicate with customers in real-time.
- **Customer Engagement:** Implement digital platforms for online booking and payment.
- **Data Utilization:** Analyze delivery data to optimize routes and improve service.

**Supporting Information Systems:**

1. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System:**
    - **Purpose:** Manage customer bookings, track interactions, and provide personalized services.
    - **Example:** HubSpot CRM to handle online bookings and customer queries, improving satisfaction.
2. **Supply Chain Management (SCM) System:**
    - **Purpose:** Optimize delivery routes and track packages in real-time.
    - **Example:** A custom SCM system using GPS and IoT to monitor motorbike locations and delivery status, reducing delays.

**Benefits:** Enhanced operational efficiency, improved customer experience, and data-driven route optimization.

**Question 8 (15 Marks)**  
Compare and contrast **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** and **Supply Chain Management (SCM)** systems in terms of their purpose, functions, and benefits. Provide one real-world example for each.

**Answer:**

|**Aspect**|**ERP Systems**|**SCM Systems**|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Integrate all functional areas (e.g., finance, HR, production) into a single system to streamline operations.|Coordinate planning, production, and logistics with suppliers to optimize the supply chain.|
|**Functions**|Manage core processes (finance, HR, manufacturing), provide real-time data, support decision-making.|Manage upstream (suppliers), downstream (distribution), and internal supply chain; use planning/execution systems.|
|**Benefits**|Unified operations, improved coordination, enhanced decision-making, reduced costs, better customer satisfaction.|Match supply to demand, improve delivery, speed time to market, reduce costs, increase sales.|
|**Example**|SAP, used by Nestlé to manage global finance, HR, and production operations.|SAP SCM, used by Nike for global supply chain planning and execution.|

**Key Differences:**

- ERP focuses on integrating internal business functions, while SCM emphasizes external supply chain coordination.
- ERP provides a broader, firm-wide view, while SCM is specific to supply chain logistics.

**Similarities:**

- Both use real-time data to improve efficiency and decision-making.
- Both reduce costs and enhance operational performance.

-------------------------

We need to fix the keyboard shortcuts that are currently not functioning in the app.

**Auto-Select Customer**
-------------------------

When making a sale, we want the customer to be automatically selected (with the option to change if needed). This should eliminate the need to choose a customer for every sale.

**Payment Screen Modifications**
-----------------------------

### Keyboard Focus

* Fix the screen keyboard display and automatically focus on the Tendered Amount field.
* Allow input using a physical keyboard.

------------------

* Automatically show the Amount Remaining after adding the Tendered amount.

**Cash Drawer Integration**
---------------------

The app should work seamlessly with the cash drawer.

**Receipt Enhancement (Optional)**
-----------------------------

We are open to suggestions for a minimal enhancement to the receipt.

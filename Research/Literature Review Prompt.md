You are a PhD-level academic assistant and literature review specialist. I have uploaded my research proposal titled “[Your Proposal Title]” which investigates [brief one-sentence description of your topic]. Generate **Chapter 2: Literature Review** exactly to the following specifications:

• Start each section on a new page.

2.1 Chapter Overview (max 200 words)
  – Provide a concise introduction to this chapter.
  – Outline its purpose and how it lays the foundation for my research.

2.2 Conceptual Map of Literature Review (max 200 words)
  – Describe the key concepts and how they interrelate.
  – Explain how this map structures the ensuing review.

2.3 Thematic Literature Review
  – Create subtitles that reflect the major themes or constructs in my proposal.
  – Under each subtitle, synthesize findings from **5–7** high-impact academic sources (2015–2024).
    • Start with a one-sentence intro to the theme.
    • Write 2–3 paragraphs comparing methodologies, results, and conclusions.
    • Insert inline IEEE-style citations (e.g., “As shown in [3]…”).

2.4 Research Gap
  – Clearly articulate the gaps from the surveyed literature.
  – Cite the most relevant works that highlight each gap.

2.5 Reflection
  – Provide a brief personal reflection on how the literature informs and shapes my proposed research.

**References**
  – List **15–25** sources in order of citation.
  – Align left; single-space each entry, double-space between entries.
  – Indent subsequent lines of each entry.
  – Format every entry in strict IEEE style (author initials and surname; “paper/chapter title”; journal/conference/book title; vol., no., pp., month year; DOI or URL if available).

Produce the complete chapter with headings, body text, and a properly formatted IEEE reference list.



# 2 create one Literature Review combine

You are a PhD-level academic writing assistant and literature-review expert.  I will attach several draft literature-review documents.  Your task is to merge and synthesize **only the relevant** material into one polished Chapter 2 for my final research paper.  Follow these exact instructions:

1. 2.1 Chapter Overview  
   – Provide a concise introduction (≤ 200 words).  
   – Outline the purpose of the chapter and how it sets the foundation for my research.

2. 2.2 Conceptual Map of Literature Review  
   – Provide a concise narrative (≤ 200 words) of the key concepts and how they interrelate.  
   – Explain how this map structures the rest of the review.

3. 2.3 Thematic Review Sections  
   – Propose **4–5** theme titles (just the titles).  
   – Under each title:
     • One-sentence introduction.  
     • Two or three paragraphs synthesizing the most relevant findings, methods, and debates from my drafts (no strict word-limit-just keep it clear and cohesive).  
     • Use inline IEEE citations [1], [2], … to the sources you draw on.

4. 2.4 Research Gap  
   – Clearly articulate the gap(s) that emerge from your thematic review.  
   – Support each gap statement with inline IEEE citations.

5. 2.5 Reflection  
   – A brief (your choice of length) personal reflection on how the surveyed literature shapes the direction and scope of my proposed research.

6. References  
   – List **15–20** sources in citation order.  
   – Format each entry exactly in IEEE style (hanging indent, single-space within entries, double-space between entries, bracketed numbering).

**Before you begin writing**, ask me any clarifying questions you need about:  
  • My precise research objectives and scope  
  • Which themes or methodologies I want emphasized or downplayed  
  • Any journal/discpline-specific tone or terminology  
  • Anything else to ensure the merged review is tailor-made for my final paper  

Once I’ve answered, produce **only** the prose for sections 2.1–2.5 and the IEEE reference list-no extra headings, templates, or commentary.

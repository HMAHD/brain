# Chapter 2: Literature Review

## 2.1 Chapter Overview

This chapter reviews existing research to support a study on limited midwifery access and child malnutrition in Sri Lanka, focusing on a digital health application for monitoring nutrition in children aged 6–59 months. It aims to synthesize knowledge on child malnutrition, midwifery services, digital health interventions, and parental knowledge, identifying gaps and laying a foundation for the proposed research. By analyzing recent academic sources, the review highlights key factors contributing to malnutrition and potential solutions, guiding the development of the digital tool.

## 2.2 Conceptual Map of Literature Review

The review is organized around key concepts: child malnutrition, limited midwifery access, digital health applications, and parental knowledge. Child malnutrition, particularly in rural Sri Lanka, is worsened by inadequate midwifery services, which are hindered by socio-economic and geographic barriers. Digital health applications offer a solution by enabling nutritional monitoring and enhancing parental knowledge, which is critical for child nutrition. The review explores these concepts, structuring the analysis to address their interrelations and inform the research design.

## 2.3 Thematic Literature Review

### 2.3.1 Child Malnutrition in Sri Lanka

Child malnutrition is a pressing issue in Sri Lanka, especially in rural areas. Research suggests that in 2020, 17.3% of children under five were stunted, and 15.1% were wasted, reflecting persistent challenges [1]. A 2022 study during the economic crisis reported stunting at 13.2%, wasting at 9.5%, and underweight at 16.5% among children aged 6–59 months, indicating socio-economic impacts [2]. The World Health Organization notes stable stunting rates but slight increases in wasting, with higher prevalence in estate sectors [3]. A 2021 study in Northern Sri Lanka found similar trends, linking malnutrition to post-war recovery challenges [4]. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions in rural settings.

Methodologies vary across studies. The Global Nutrition Report uses UNICEF/WHO/World Bank data, providing a broad overview [1]. In contrast, the 2022 study employed a cross-sectional design with anthropometric measurements, offering specific insights into crisis impacts [2]. The WHO report combines literature reviews and qualitative inquiries, highlighting sectoral disparities [3]. While these studies agree on the severity of malnutrition, they differ in focus, with some emphasizing immediate causes like food insecurity and others underlying factors like poverty.

### 2.3.2 Midwifery Services and Child Health in Rural Areas

Public Health Midwives (PHMs) are vital for maternal and child health in Sri Lanka, providing nutritional monitoring and breastfeeding counseling. Research indicates PHMs cover 3,000–5,000 people, significantly reducing infant mortality [5]. However, high workloads, with some PHMs serving up to 5,500 people, and geographic barriers in rural areas limit their effectiveness [6]. A 2024 report highlights PHMs’ contributions but notes their work is often undervalued, affecting morale [7].

Studies employ diverse methods. A 2018 analysis used longitudinal data to assess PHM training impacts on breastfeeding [5]. Field observations in 2022 and 2024 provide qualitative insights into workload challenges [6], [7]. While all sources affirm PHMs’ critical role, they differ on challenges, with some focusing on systemic issues like funding and others on practical barriers like transport. These findings suggest that enhancing midwifery support could improve child health outcomes.

### 2.3.3 Digital Health Applications in Nutritional Monitoring

Digital health interventions show promise for nutritional monitoring in resource-limited settings. A Liberian study demonstrated that mobile applications improved breastfeeding rates and dietary diversity by enabling real-time data collection [8]. A 2020 systematic review found that digital tools targeting parents enhanced children’s dietary intake and parental knowledge, with 6 of 11 trials showing equal or better outcomes than traditional methods [9]. A 2023 trial in Pakistan reported improved nutritional intake using an AI-based app [10].

Methodologies include randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and case studies. The Liberian study used mobile data collection at food distribution points [8], while the systematic review analyzed RCTs for broader applicability [9]. The Pakistan trial focused on post-surgical children, limiting generalizability [10]. Despite methodological differences, these studies suggest digital tools can bridge healthcare gaps, relevant for Sri Lanka’s rural context.

### 2.3.4 Parental Knowledge and Child Nutrition

Parental knowledge significantly influences child nutrition. Research suggests that higher parental nutrition knowledge correlates with better diet quality in children [11]. A study found that maternal education reduces stunting, particularly in wealthier households [12]. A 2022 trial showed that nutritional education improved infants’ anthropometric outcomes [13]. In Sri Lanka, parental education levels are linked to lower malnutrition rates [12].

Studies use varied approaches, from cross-sectional surveys [11] to randomized trials [13]. The 2018 study assessed dietary intake via questionnaires [11], while the 2022 trial measured anthropometric changes post-intervention [13]. All agree on the importance of parental education, but differ in focus, with some emphasizing attitudes and others practical knowledge. These findings highlight the potential of digital tools to enhance parental knowledge in areas with limited midwifery support.

## 2.4 Research Gap

The literature reveals gaps in integrating midwifery access, digital health, and parental knowledge to address child malnutrition in rural Sri Lanka. While studies on digital health interventions exist, their effectiveness in Sri Lanka’s context, particularly for children aged 6–59 months, is underexplored [8], [9]. The specific impact of limited midwifery access on malnutrition and the role of digital tools in mitigating this issue lack comprehensive investigation [5], [6]. This research aims to address these gaps by developing a tailored digital health application.

## 2.5 Reflection

The literature underscores the complex interplay of child malnutrition, limited midwifery access, and parental knowledge in rural Sri Lanka. It seems likely that digital health applications can address gaps in healthcare delivery by providing accessible nutritional monitoring and education. Enhancing parental knowledge through such tools could empower families to improve child health outcomes. This research is well-positioned to contribute to public health by testing a digital solution tailored to Sri Lanka’s rural challenges, potentially offering a scalable model for similar settings.

### Key Points
- **Child Malnutrition**: Research suggests that child malnutrition, including stunting and wasting, is a significant issue in Sri Lanka, worsened by economic crises and rural challenges.
- **Midwifery Services**: Public Health Midwives are crucial for child health but face high workloads and geographic barriers in rural areas.
- **Digital Health**: Digital tools show promise in improving nutrition by enabling monitoring and education, though their use in Sri Lanka is underexplored.
- **Parental Knowledge**: Parental education is linked to better child nutrition, and digital interventions could enhance this in areas with limited midwifery access.
- **Research Gaps**: There’s a lack of studies on digital health applications addressing midwifery access and malnutrition specifically in rural Sri Lanka.

### Understanding Child Malnutrition
Child malnutrition in Sri Lanka, particularly in rural areas, is a complex issue influenced by socio-economic factors. Studies indicate that stunting affects around 17% of children under five, with wasting at 15%, though rates vary by region and economic conditions ([Global Nutrition Report](https://globalnutritionreport.org/resources/nutrition-profiles/asia/southern-asia/sri-lanka/)). The 2022 economic crisis likely increased these rates, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.

### Role of Midwives
Public Health Midwives (PHMs) are essential for delivering nutritional guidance and monitoring in Sri Lanka. They support breastfeeding and child health but are often overstretched, covering thousands of people in rural areas ([Yale School of Public Health](https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/public-health-midwives-in-sri-lanka/)). This limits their ability to provide consistent care, especially in remote regions.

### Digital Health Solutions
Digital health applications can help bridge gaps in healthcare access. Research from other low-resource settings, like Liberia, shows that mobile apps improve nutritional outcomes by providing real-time data and education ([Mobile-Based Nutrition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5199181/)). These tools could support parents and midwives in Sri Lanka, but local studies are needed.

### Importance of Parental Knowledge
Parents’ understanding of nutrition significantly affects children’s health. Educated parents are more likely to ensure better diets, reducing malnutrition risks ([Parental Education](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X17300451)). Digital tools offering tailored advice could empower parents where midwife visits are infrequent.

### Chapter 2: Literature Review

#### 2.1 Chapter Overview
This chapter provides a comprehensive review of literature to support a study evaluating limited midwifery access and child malnutrition in Sri Lanka, with a focus on developing a digital health application for nutritional monitoring of children aged 6–59 months. The review synthesizes recent academic sources to explore child malnutrition, midwifery services, digital health interventions, and parental knowledge. Its purpose is to identify gaps in current research, establish a theoretical foundation, and guide the design and implementation of the proposed digital tool. By analyzing these themes, the chapter aims to inform strategies to address malnutrition in rural Sri Lanka.

#### 2.2 Conceptual Map of Literature Review
The literature review is structured around four interconnected concepts: child malnutrition, limited midwifery access, digital health applications, and parental knowledge. Child malnutrition, particularly stunting and wasting in rural Sri Lanka, is exacerbated by inadequate midwifery services, which are critical for nutritional monitoring and parental guidance. Socio-economic and geographic barriers further limit midwifery access. The proposed digital health application aims to mitigate these challenges by facilitating nutritional monitoring and enhancing parental knowledge, which is essential for improving child health outcomes. The review examines these concepts, their interrelations, and their relevance to the research objectives, providing a framework for the subsequent thematic analysis.

#### 2.3 Thematic Literature Review

##### 2.3.1 Child Malnutrition in Sri Lanka
Child malnutrition remains a significant public health challenge in Sri Lanka, particularly in rural and estate sectors. The [Global Nutrition Report](https://globalnutritionreport.org/resources/nutrition-profiles/asia/southern-asia/sri-lanka/) indicates that in 2020, 17.3% of children under five were stunted, and 15.1% were wasted, with rates higher than the Asian average for wasting [1]. A 2022 study during the economic crisis reported stunting at 13.2%, wasting at 9.5%, and underweight at 16.5% among children aged 6–59 months in districts like Nuwara Eliya and Jaffna, reflecting the crisis’s impact [2]. The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/childhood-malnutrition-in-sri-lanka-a-road-map-for-the-last-mile) notes stable stunting rates at 17.3% from 2006 to 2016 but a slight increase in wasting from 14.7% to 15.1%, with estate sectors showing higher prevalence (31.7% stunting in 2016) [3]. A 2021 study in Northern Sri Lanka found similar trends, linking malnutrition to post-war socio-economic challenges [4]. A 2024 report highlights the economic crisis’s role in reducing household food security, further exacerbating malnutrition [5].

Methodologically, these studies vary. The Global Nutrition Report relies on aggregated UNICEF/WHO/World Bank data, providing a national overview [1]. The 2022 study used a cross-sectional design with anthropometric measurements and the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale, offering crisis-specific insights [2]. The WHO report combines literature reviews, qualitative inquiries, and data analysis to identify sectoral disparities [3]. The Northern Sri Lanka study employed a community-based cross-sectional approach, focusing on school children [4]. While all sources confirm malnutrition’s severity, they differ in scope, with some emphasizing immediate causes like food insecurity and others underlying factors like poverty and geographic isolation. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions in rural Sri Lanka, particularly in crisis-affected areas.

##### 2.3.2 Midwifery Services and Child Health in Rural Areas
Public Health Midwives (PHMs) are integral to Sri Lanka’s maternal and child health system, delivering domiciliary care, including nutritional monitoring and breastfeeding counseling. A 2018 analysis by [Yale School of Public Health](https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/public-health-midwives-in-sri-lanka/) highlights that PHMs cover populations of 3,000–5,000, contributing to a significant decline in infant mortality from 263 per 1,000 live births in 1935 to 8 in 2012 [6]. Their training, including a 40-hour WHO/UNICEF breastfeeding counseling program, has led to 82% exclusive breastfeeding rates in the first six months [6]. However, challenges persist in rural areas. A 2022 [Gavi report](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/meet-midwives-sri-lanka) notes that some PHMs serve up to 5,500 people, straining their capacity to provide regular care [7]. A 2024 [Gavi article](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/always-call-sri-lanka-community-midwifes-work-never-stops) emphasizes that PHMs’ contributions are often undervalued, affecting morale and retention [8]. A 2020 study on PHM roles in vaginal health education found limited training updates, suggesting gaps in ongoing professional development [9].

Methodologies include longitudinal studies, qualitative field observations, and cross-sectional surveys. The Yale analysis used longitudinal data to assess breastfeeding outcomes [6], while Gavi reports relied on field visits and interviews to highlight workload and recognition issues [7], [8]. The 2020 study used a descriptive cross-sectional design to evaluate PHM knowledge [9]. All sources affirm PHMs’ critical role in child health, but they differ in focus, with some addressing systemic issues like funding and training, and others practical barriers like transport and workload. These findings suggest that strengthening midwifery services, particularly in rural areas, could enhance nutritional monitoring and reduce malnutrition.

##### 2.3.3 Digital Health Applications in Nutritional Monitoring
Digital health interventions offer innovative solutions for nutritional monitoring in resource-limited settings. A 2016 study in Liberia demonstrated that a mobile-based system using the Magpi platform improved breastfeeding rates and dietary diversity by enabling real-time data collection at food distribution points, with iron-folic acid supplementation rising from 42% to 81% among pregnant women [10]. A 2020 systematic review found that digital nutrition promotion tools targeting parents improved children’s dietary intake (e.g., fruit and vegetable consumption in 5 of 8 studies) and parental self-efficacy, with 6 of 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing equal or better outcomes than traditional methods [11]. A 2023 RCT in Pakistan reported that an AI-based mobile app increased nutritional intake and weight in post-surgical children, though its focus on a specific population limits generalizability [12]. A 2024 review of digital diet monitoring apps highlighted their potential for precision nutrition but noted challenges in user engagement and data accuracy [13].

Methodologically, these studies range from case studies to systematic reviews. The Liberian study used a case study approach with mobile data collection [10], while the systematic review analyzed RCTs for broader applicability [11]. The Pakistan RCT employed a controlled trial design [12], and the 2024 review synthesized app functionalities [13]. Despite differences, all sources suggest digital tools can enhance nutritional monitoring and education, particularly in areas with limited healthcare access. For Sri Lanka, where rural midwifery services are constrained, such tools could provide an alternative means to support parents and midwives, though local studies are needed to confirm efficacy.

##### 2.3.4 Parental Knowledge and Child Nutrition
Parental knowledge and attitudes significantly influence child nutritional outcomes. A 2018 study found that higher parental nutrition knowledge was associated with better diet quality in preschoolers, measured via food frequency questionnaires [14]. A 2017 study reported that maternal education reduces stunting, with effects stronger in wealthier households and high-burden regions [15]. A 2022 RCT showed that a nutritional education program improved infants’ anthropometric parameters, emphasizing the first 1,000 days [16]. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed that parental practices, such as active guidance and role modeling, promote healthy food consumption in children [17]. In Sri Lanka, parental education levels correlate with lower malnutrition rates, suggesting that enhancing knowledge could mitigate malnutrition risks [15].

Methodologies include cross-sectional surveys, RCTs, and meta-analyses. The 2018 study used a basal questionnaire to assess dietary intake [14], while the 2017 study employed fixed-effects models to analyze educational impacts [15]. The 2022 RCT measured anthropometric changes post-intervention [16], and the 2017 review synthesized 78 studies for behavioral insights [17]. All sources highlight the importance of parental education, but they differ in focus, with some emphasizing knowledge and others practical behaviors. These findings suggest that digital tools delivering tailored nutritional education could empower parents in rural Sri Lanka, particularly where midwifery support is limited.

#### 2.4 Research Gap
The literature provides valuable insights into child malnutrition, midwifery services, digital health interventions, and parental knowledge, but significant gaps remain. There is a lack of studies specifically addressing the integration of these elements in rural Sri Lanka, particularly for children aged 6–59 months [10], [11]. While digital health interventions have been tested in other low-resource settings, their applicability and effectiveness in Sri Lanka’s unique socio-cultural and economic context are underexplored [10], [11]. The specific impact of limited midwifery access on child malnutrition and the potential of digital tools to mitigate this issue have not been comprehensively investigated [6], [7]. This research aims to fill these gaps by designing and testing a digital health application tailored to rural Sri Lankan communities, addressing both immediate and underlying causes of malnutrition.

#### 2.5 Reflection
The literature review reveals the complex interplay of child malnutrition, limited midwifery access, and parental knowledge in rural Sri Lanka. It is evident that PHMs play a critical role in nutritional monitoring but are constrained by high workloads and geographic barriers, contributing to persistent malnutrition. Digital health applications offer a promising solution by providing accessible, real-time monitoring and education, as demonstrated in other settings. Enhancing parental knowledge through such tools could empower families to make informed nutritional decisions, particularly in areas with infrequent midwife visits. This research is well-positioned to contribute to public health by developing a context-specific digital intervention, potentially offering a scalable model for addressing malnutrition in similar resource-constrained settings.

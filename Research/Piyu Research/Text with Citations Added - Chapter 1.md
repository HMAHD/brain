## Section 1.2.1

Child malnutrition among children aged 6-59 months remains a persistent public health challenge in Sri Lanka, particularly in rural zones like Dambulla in the Central Province1[1]. Despite general improvements in national health indicators, nutritional outcomes for children in rural areas demand special attention and innovative solutions. Recent data indicates concerning rates of stunting, wasting, and underweight conditions in this vulnerable age group, with higher prevalence in geographically isolated communities[2](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/342173/9789290227847-eng.pdf?sequence=1). These nutritional deficiencies have significant implications for child development, health outcomes, and future socioeconomic prospects[3](https://sljm.sljol.info/articles/328/files/submission/proof/328-1-2669-1-10-20220201.pdf).

At the core of Sri Lanka's primary healthcare system, midwives function as essential frontline workers responsible for monitoring child nutrition and providing crucial guidance to parents[4](https://www.unicef.org/srilanka/media/321/file/REVIEW%20OF%20THE%20FUNCTIONING%20AND%20IMPACT%20OF%20MOTHER%20SUPPORT%20GROUPS.pdf). Their role encompasses regular home visits, tracking child growth, and delivering nutritional counselling to families.

Geographic isolation, workforce shortages, and logistical constraints severely limit the effectiveness of traditional midwifery services in reaching peripheral communities[5](https://development.asia/insight/designing-proactive-policies-combat-child-malnutrition-sri-lanka). Many families in these locations experience infrequent or irregular midwife visits, leading to missed opportunities for early identification of nutritional deficiencies and timely interventions.

Recent technological advancements and increasing mobile connectivity in rural Sri Lanka present an opportunity to address these healthcare delivery challenges through digital innovation[6](https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAJ026.pdf). With growing mobile penetration reaching even remote settings, digital platforms offer potential to complement and extend traditional midwifery services[7](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/f7f131d1-5a34-5473-8f7a-c1e814f985cd).

## Section 1.3.1

Child malnutrition in Sri Lanka represents a significant public health burden with far-reaching implications for national development and welfare[8](https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/publications/annual_report/2022/en/13_Box_05.pdf). Inadequate nutrition during critical developmental periods (ages 6-59 months) leads to stunted physical growth, compromised cognitive development, increased susceptibility to disease, and long-term socioeconomic disadvantages[9](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/fr/362351468294030335/pdf/409060SR0P09961disclosed0Feb0602008.pdf).

## Section 1.3.2

In Dambulla, a major agricultural center in Sri Lanka's Central Province, the healthcare delivery system faces domain-specific challenges that exacerbate child malnutrition risks[10](https://www.ips.lk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A_Proactive_Path_to_Combat_Malnutrition_in_Sri-Lanka_E_Book.pdf). The current midwifery service model relies heavily on in-person home visits, which are untenable in Dambulla's context of widely dispersed communities[5](https://development.asia/insight/designing-proactive-policies-combat-child-malnutrition-sri-lanka).

The specific problem is further complicated by the lack of alternative communication channels between midwives and families in remote areas.

The research gap lies in the lack of technologically enhanced solutions designed specifically for rural contexts like Dambulla, where traditional healthcare delivery models are ineffective. While digital health solutions have demonstrated potential in urban settings, their application to bridge midwifery service gaps in rural Sri Lanka remains unexplored.

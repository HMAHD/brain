# Chapter 2: Literature Review  

## 2.1 Chapter Overview  
This chapter establishes the foundation for developing a culturally adaptive Sinhala language model by analyzing three critical domains: linguistic challenges unique to Sinhala, advancements in low-resource language modeling, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. It synthesizes 18 key studies (2019–2025) to identify technical gaps in Sinhala NLP systems, evaluate multilingual model limitations, and demonstrate how modern PEFT methods enable resource-efficient adaptation. The analysis culminates in a framework for building idiom-aware conversational AI that respects Sri Lankan linguistic norms while maintaining computational practicality.  

## 2.2 Conceptual Map of Literature Review  
The review navigates an interconnected triad of concepts: **linguistic complexity** (Sinhala's diglossic variations and morphological richness), **technical constraints** (data scarcity and computational resource limitations), and **cultural representation** (preserving idiomatic expressions and context sensitivity). These elements inform the model architecture selection criteria, emphasizing lightweight base models (SmolLM, TinyLlama) enhanced through PEFT rather than monolithic LLMs. The thematic structure prioritizes solutions that bridge computational efficiency with cultural fidelity, rejecting the false dichotomy between model size and linguistic nuance.  

## 2.3 Thematic Review Sections  

### Theme 1: Linguistic and Cultural Challenges in Sinhala NLP  
**Core Issue**: Structural barriers to digital Sinhala representation.  
Sinhala's diglossic (bilingual) nature creates a fundamental disconnect between written (literary) and spoken forms, with subject-verb agreement rules varying significantly[12][16]. Morphological complexity compounds this challenge-verbs inflect for gender, number, and person through 85+ documented rules, while nouns follow 18+ inflection patterns[12]. Current translation systems achieve only 35-87% accuracy for well-structured sentences[5], dropping sharply with idiomatic expressions like "අත පුඩුව" (hand-basket, implying futility). Resource scarcity exacerbates these issues: despite 16 million speakers, annotated corpora remain limited to ~500k news articles[16] and 7.3M sentences in Glot500[16], with code-mixing further complicating NLP tasks[14].  

### Theme 2: Sinhala-Specific Language Model Development  
**Breakthrough**: Monolingual models outperform multilingual equivalents.  
XLM-R achieves 91% F1-score in text classification despite being multilingual[6], while Sinhala-RoBERTa demonstrates 15% higher accuracy in sentiment analysis through targeted pre-training[11]. Hybrid architectures show particular promise: a Sinhala-Evolutionary Algorithm translation system preserves contextual meaning 23% better than seq2seq models[5], and transformer-based chatbots achieve 89% intent recognition accuracy using culturally adapted NLU pipelines[10]. However, even state-of-the-art models struggle with temporal deixis ("අද" vs "හෙට"-today vs tomorrow) due to limited temporal corpora[16].  

### Theme 3: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) Techniques  
**Key Insight**: LoRA/QLoRA enable cultural adaptation without retraining.  
In low-resource Sinhala fine-tuning, LoRA achieves 92% of full fine-tuning performance using only 0.1% trainable parameters[7][9]. QLoRA further reduces memory requirements by 45% through 4-bit quantization, crucial for deploying models on Sri Lanka's prevalent mid-range GPUs[8][15]. The DoRA variant improves idiom comprehension by 18% through weight decomposition[7], while prompt tuning proves ineffective for Sinhala's free-word-order syntax[15]. Crucially, PEFT allows iterative cultural adaptation-a Gemma-360M model fine-tuned with LoRA on 15k Sinhala dialogues matches GPT-4's cultural relevance scores at 1/50th the cost[7][13].  

### Theme 4: Evaluation Metrics and Practical Applications  
**Validation Gap**: Current metrics ignore cultural fidelity.  
While BLEU scores dominate translation research (0.17-0.26 for Sinhala-English systems[5]), they fail to capture idiom preservation or honorific usage. Emerging hybrid metrics combine semantic similarity (BERTScore) with cultural checklists-a 2025 framework evaluates "ඔබ" (formal you) vs "තොපි" (informal you) usage accuracy[14]. Practical implementations reveal scalability challenges: a government chatbot handles 70 queries/minute[5], but complex sentences increase latency by 300%[10]. Successful deployments in participatory development demonstrate 35% accuracy gains through Sinhala-specific RAG architectures[14].  

## 2.4 Research Gap  
Three critical gaps emerge:  
1. **Cultural Metrics**: No standardized benchmarks evaluate idiom handling or honorific appropriateness in Sinhala NLP systems[5][16].  
2. **Dynamic Code-Mixing**: Existing models treat Sinhala-English code-switching as noise rather than a linguistic feature[14][16].  
3. **Efficiency Tradeoffs**: Lightweight models sacrifice contextual depth-TinyLlama-1.1B shows 40% drop in multi-turn dialogue coherence compared to 7B models[13][15].  

## 2.5 Reflection  
This analysis validates the core thesis: cultural fluency in Sinhala AI requires targeted architectural choices rather than scaled-up multilingual models. The PEFT-driven approach enables continuous adaptation to Sri Lanka's evolving linguistic landscape, particularly through community-driven datasets[14]. However, the reviewed studies expose a critical need for idiom corpora and temporal language models-gaps this research will address through collaborative data collection with Sri Lankan linguists.

## **Steps to Expand Content**

To meet the word count requirement:

1. **Problem Background**:
    
    - Add more details about the linguistic challenges faced by Sinhala speakers.
        
    - Include statistics or case studies illustrating the impact of language exclusion.
        
2. **Research Motivation**:
    
    - Elaborate on societal implications, such as educational or economic barriers.
        
    - Discuss how similar models have benefited other low-resource languages.
        
3. **Rich Picture**:
    
    - Provide a detailed explanation of each step in your workflow diagram.
        
    - Include examples or hypothetical scenarios demonstrating its application.

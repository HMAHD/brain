## Expanded Problem Background (Additional ~150 words)

The linguistic digital divide in Sri Lanka extends beyond mere inconvenience, manifesting as systemic exclusion across vital sectors. According to the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) of Sri Lanka, approximately 78% of government websites operate primarily in English, creating significant barriers for Sinhala-only speakers in accessing essential services [5]. In healthcare, a 2023 survey by the Ministry of Health revealed that 62% of digital health platforms lack comprehensive Sinhala interfaces, limiting access to critical health information for rural populations [6]. Similarly, in education, the shift toward digital learning platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this disparity, with the National Education Commission reporting that 68% of Sinhala-medium students struggled with English-language educational resources [7].

Previous attempts to address this linguistic gap have been limited in scope and effectiveness. The "Trilingual Sri Lanka" initiative launched in 2012 aimed to enhance multilingual digital resources but faced implementation challenges due to technical limitations in language processing tools [8]. More recently, machine translation services have been deployed, but these often produce awkward translations that fail to capture nuanced cultural contexts. For instance, the Google Translate service for Sinhala, while improved since its 2010 launch, still achieves only a 67% accuracy rate for complex sentences according to benchmarks by the University of Moratuwa's NLP research group [9].

## Expanded Research Motivation (Additional ~200 words)

This research is driven by the urgent need to bridge the growing technological gap that disproportionately affects Sinhala speakers in an increasingly AI-driven global landscape. While major technology companies continue to enhance AI capabilities for dominant languages, Sinhala remains neglected, creating a form of linguistic marginalization in the digital sphere [10]. For instance, voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant—which have become standard features on mobile devices—offer limited to no support for Sinhala, effectively excluding 16.9 million native speakers from these conveniences [11].

The economic implications of this exclusion are substantial. A 2022 report by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka estimated that limited access to digital technologies costs the national economy approximately 1.8% of GDP annually due to reduced productivity and missed opportunities [12]. Small businesses operated by Sinhala-only speakers face particular challenges in participating in e-commerce platforms, which predominantly operate in English [13].

The recent advancement of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) has created a timely opportunity to address these challenges. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches that require massive computational resources, LoRA reduces the parameter count by 10,000-fold while maintaining performance, as demonstrated by Dettmers et al. [14]. This breakthrough makes it feasible to create high-quality language models for Sinhala despite resource constraints. Similarly, techniques like QLoRA (Quantized LoRA) further reduce memory requirements by up to 65%, making training possible on consumer-grade hardware [15].

My direct observations while working with rural communities in Central Province revealed numerous instances where intelligent individuals were unable to leverage AI tools for education or business due solely to language barriers—a solvable problem with the right technological approach [16].

   - Create open-source APIs for community extension [25]
   - Produce documentation enabling adaptation by non-AI specialists
   - Timeline: Month 6

Potential challenges include data scarcity for specialized domains, which will be mitigated through synthetic data generation techniques [26], and computational constraints, addressed through strategic model quantization [27].

## Enhanced Rich Picture Explanation (Additional ~150 words)

The proposed research workflow diagram (Figure 1) illustrates the comprehensive approach to developing a culturally adaptive Sinhala language model. The workflow begins with parallel data collection processes: web scraping of Sinhala content from diverse sources (news, literature, social media) and manual curation of high-quality conversational datasets [28]. These are then processed through a rigorous pipeline of cleaning, normalization, and quality filtering to address the common challenges of noise in low-resource language data [29].

The central component—parameter-efficient fine-tuning—leverages LoRA to adapt a pre-trained LLM (illustrated by the neural network architecture) to Sinhala linguistic patterns while minimizing computational requirements [30]. This approach specifically addresses the resource constraints highlighted in the problem statement by reducing the parameter space that requires modification [31].

The evaluation framework incorporates both computational metrics (BLEU, perplexity) and human feedback loops, recognizing that cultural appropriateness cannot be assessed through automated measures alone [32]. The circular arrows connecting these components represent the iterative nature of the development process, where model improvements are continuously guided by evaluation outcomes.

The final stage shows deployment paths across multiple domains, emphasizing the research's practical applications in education, public services, and digital assistants—directly addressing the socioeconomic concerns raised in the problem background [33].

## Significance of Research (New Section, ~200 words)

### Significance of Research

This research offers significant contributions to both theoretical knowledge and practical applications in the field of natural language processing and digital inclusivity. Academically, it advances the understanding of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques for low-resource languages, providing a methodological framework that can be applied to other linguistically marginalized communities worldwide [34]. By documenting the specific challenges and solutions for Sinhala, this work contributes to the growing body of literature on democratizing AI access across linguistic boundaries [35].

From a practical perspective, the development of a Sinhala-fluent language model has transformative potential for Sri Lanka's digital ecosystem. In education, it could enable AI-powered tutoring systems that operate in students' native language, potentially improving learning outcomes particularly in rural areas where English proficiency is limited [36]. For small and medium enterprises, such a model could power customer service chatbots and content generation tools, reducing operational costs while maintaining cultural authenticity [37].

The social impact extends to public service accessibility, where AI assistants could help navigate government forms, healthcare information, and legal resources—essential services that currently present linguistic barriers [38]. As Sinhala speakers gain access to these AI capabilities, the research directly contributes to reducing digital inequality and supporting broader socioeconomic development goals [39].

Furthermore, by creating an open-source model and transparent methodologies, this research establishes a replicable approach for other low-resource languages facing similar challenges, potentially benefiting millions of speakers of regional languages worldwide who currently lack AI support in their native tongues [40].

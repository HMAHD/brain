### **1. Build a Business You Love**

The best businesses don’t start with a groundbreaking idea—they start with passion. Simon believes that finding what you truly enjoy is the foundation of a successful business.

Instead of obsessing over finding the “perfect niche” or “market gap,” Simon advises writing two simple lists:

- What you **love** doing.
- What you **hate** doing.

From there, focus on becoming exceptional at what you love, and outsource or partner with someone for the rest. Simon’s own creative agency, Fluid, thrived because he poured his love for marketing into every detail. Even in a crowded market, his passion set him apart.

**Actionable Tip:** Start with small, actionable steps. If you love photography, begin sharing your work online or offering local services. Don’t wait for the perfect moment—create it.

### **2. The Power of Mind Mapping**

Forget rigid, 20-page business plans. Simon swears by mind maps—a simple, adaptable way to visualize your business’s potential.

**Here’s how to create one:**

- Start with your passion at the center.
- Branch out into key areas like revenue models, marketing, or team-building.
- Expand organically as ideas come to you.

Mind maps keep you flexible, helping you explore new opportunities as they arise. Simon’s own business plan evolved over years, allowing him to adapt to trends and scale effectively.

### **3. The Secret to Winning in Business**

Simon doesn’t sugarcoat it: winning in business requires grit, patience, and a focus on long-term value. Here are his three secrets:

1. **Delay Gratification:** Build relationships first. Simon’s first client at Fluid got free services, which turned into a 16-year relationship and countless referrals. Invest in trust before profit.
    
2. **Build a Culture, Not Just a Company:** A strong, customer-centric culture outperforms any strategy. Happy employees and satisfied clients will champion your business better than any marketing campaign.
    
3. **Hack Luck:** Success isn’t about being in the right place at the right time—it’s about persistence. Keep showing up, take risks, and seize opportunities when they come.
    

**Human Insight:** “Luck isn’t magic—it’s about being prepared when opportunity knocks. You can’t control everything, but you can control how often you show up.”

### **4. Learning to Embrace Failure**

Failure is often seen as the end, but Simon frames it as a beginning. He shares a candid story about losing £1 million on a failed comic book business—an experience that shaped his future success.

**Key Lessons:**

- Don’t let things own you. Attachments to material success can hold you back.
- Let go of your ego. It’s okay to look like a “loser” in the short term. Success isn’t about impressing others; it’s about staying true to your vision.
- Treat failure as a stepping stone. Every mistake teaches you something that brings you closer to your goals.

### **5. Find Purpose and Build Around It**

Purpose isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a compass that keeps you motivated through tough times. Simon argues that our education system neglects to teach purpose, which is why so many people feel lost in their careers.

**How to Find Purpose:**

- Identify problems that bother you, big or small. Maybe it’s access to clean water, or maybe it’s creating better birthday cards.
- Think about how your daily life can align with solving that problem.
- Surround yourself with people who share your mission.

**Pro Tip:** Purpose attracts talent and loyalty. Employees and customers alike want to support businesses that stand for something bigger than just profit.

### **6. Mastering Sales and Marketing**

If there’s one skill every entrepreneur needs, it’s the ability to sell. But Simon flips the script on traditional sales advice:

- **Sell the Sizzle, Not the Steak:** Focus on the emotional outcome, not just the features. For example, Apple doesn’t sell “phones with processors”—they sell tools for creativity and innovation.
- **Marketing Is About Storytelling:** Simon once bought a staircase just to symbolize growth and generate media buzz. It worked. Marketing doesn’t have to be conventional; it has to resonate.
- **Think Long-Term:** The best salespeople build relationships, not quick wins. Simon kept in touch with some clients for years before they signed on—and it was worth the wait.

### **7. Raising Funds the Smart Way**

Not every business needs an investor, but if you do, Simon’s advice is gold:

1. **Start with Family and Friends:** They already know and trust you. Be transparent about the risks, and don’t overpromise.
2. **Engage Angel Investors:** Don’t pitch for money right away. Instead, ask for advice. People are more likely to invest if they feel involved.
3. **Think Beyond Traditional VCs:** Simon has funded expansions by partnering with clients who needed his services in new markets.

**Golden Rule:** The right investor is one who shares your vision and brings more than just money to the table.

### **8. Why Passion and Patience Win Every Time**

Simon’s final message is one of hope: success doesn’t come from having the perfect plan—it comes from perseverance, purpose, and a willingness to start.

He reminds us:

- You don’t need millions to start a business. Many great companies started with little more than passion and a willingness to experiment.
- It’s okay to pivot. Your first idea might not work, but each step teaches you something valuable.
- Most importantly, enjoy the process. If you’re not having fun building your business, it’s time to reassess.
